Cleaner user interface. Dark mode. More integration capabilities

I wish we could publish social post from monday.com

hard to learn. use to regex. high pricing

It seems to struggle with being able to query large data sets. It would error out when attempting to query about 15K customer accounts. Training. I had to look on the internet for some videos to understand how the control boxes work. When we initially installed TIBCO we received a crash course. You need someone with a good analytical, technical, or data background to use this tool. Error messages doesn't always match the issue causing the error.

Tasks are limited to one project. Tags are not editable

Complexity. Pricing Transparency. Security and Compliance. Integration with External Services

Automations sometimes experience lags. The "My Work" functionality doesn't update in real time, and sometimes even refreshing the window does not work.

Lower Pricing. Communication on Benefits

Learning. Performance. Skills

Email functionality - Search by customer name. Creative portal to design and layout notifications and emails. Saving drafts sometimes does not work. In box delivery rates in e-mail need improving

Handling data history well when migrating from legacy systems. Math and Merge to near realtime.

In my experinece, I sometimes we find pop up boxes when for ex we are changing an attendees session to not show all information and you don't realize until you scroll down it is asking additional questions. I can't always find things I need in the online help searches. In my experience, often unless you get lucky with a specific wording, it's hard to find articles to help with issues.

With the PBJ reporting for CMS. better email system

Notifications. Support

It should support more functions. Pricing should be less. Hard to set up

Accessibility features - it would be awesome to have a closed captions tool for video lessons for those who do not have software that does that. Custom Dashboards in Analytics. Additional Event extraction options

I was just trying to think of any room for improvement. It's hard. It does a lot. It does what we need. It does the operations, I can't think of anything for improvement actually

Better GUI access. Advertise this quality product

Providing Cybersecurity Awareness Training Materials for October for Adults vs. Children

More bundle options that aren't food and beverage. Quicker production time. Better reporting on company store / sales

CCP (Contact Control Panel) Amazon Connect for agents very basic. Automated outgoing calls. Omnichannel to attend voice and text by the same agent

Could be a little more performant. It's not slow but some requests are slightly too slow to be customer-facing. Invest more in the data quality functionality. Better interface for permission management.

Credits do not sync well from Bill.com

I have not found any limitations thus far.

Schedule visualization could be improved. Navigation not intuitive for occasional users

Dashboard organization. Linking relevant data pieces

Coverage of integration with other security tools can be improved. Customisation of dashboard to enable customer choice of tracking. Showcase devsecops progressive tasks from SLA and violation from code scanner perspective

limitations of the Flash System 5200 and 7300, which offer a 32-gigabyte connection can be improved. This connection could be made flexible and given a choice to choose for customers like to have 16-gigabyte connections or lower and higher as well.

More improved knowledge base to help with more complex automation setup/tests.

They could use more installers

user interface was getting a bit stale - we are looking forward to implementing recent enhancements

Creating reports. Spell check

The main issue I have is you cannot change the training modules on campaigns without creating new campaigns. I like the campaigns we have but would like to swap the training modules to keep everything fresh. To create campaigns, there is no step by step process to complete them. You have to go through different sections of the software to get everything set. And some of the processes don't make a lot of sense to me in the ways they are done.

Update user interface for easier customization and corporate branding. Easier way to edit expenses added to report of mistake was made in entry (itemization)

More stickers that are beautifully designed and not so intentionally funny.

Workflows. Onboarding. Content

Upgrading the software has broken some existing backups.

AVI-SPL is fantastic. AVI-SPL always ships in schedule. AVI-SPL is very honest with me when I want something. They will tell me that might not be for me.

Customization. Customer support. Cloud based storage

Implementation of Adobe Analytics is not that simple and hence need support of the experts. Latest release on the Geographies has started impacting the data. Adobe doesn't track the APPs on url basis

I can't think any off the top of my head.

eps sizing. auto refresh on offenses page. develop use case manager add-one

the project assignment. A report was not assigned to me, and I have to ask someone to do it. Sometimes it's difficult to find projets/reports within all included in the platform. tips to improve the usage of the platform

Adding Google Docs and Videos can sometimes be challenging and not appear correctly for users. Users don't always verify cards, leading to large backlogs of unverified knowledge. Standardizing and organizing card formatting can vary widely.

Integration with other platforms such as microsoft teams. UI Design and colors for dashboards

I think it would be good to have more simplified processes for automations for users that don't have an understanding of how to use these.

Connection to cloud providers could be easier. The documentation could be more comprehensible. It would be nice to have best practices for the setup

The collaboration with the local subsidiaries could be improved. Have some follow-up contact just to ask about how it is going.

Physical backup (issues post Windows updates needing restarts). Physical test restores (recent improvements).

Reporting. Dashboards

Easier view of subtasks column headings when there are a lot of subtasks. When I last looked at one of our clients that had over 15 subtasks, it was hard to see the column headings of the subtasks because the overall column headings were over top of them.

Ways to organize within one particular board

integration with API for CMS

Add a search bar

Better table functionality. Move variable table buttons to prevent scrolling to add new variables. Ability to locate profiles when a change is needed.

Training videos could be helpful for all the tools that I have available to me. I love the potential of them all, but I worry I don't understand how to fully take advantage of all the capabilities there. Some tools feel more buried than others, making it hard to get the most out of the CMS. I wish I had some more developer tools so I could make quick and easy fixes rather than reaching out to our developers to do it for me. I have skills in that area, and I feel like I can't take advantage of them anymore.

adding more accounts. the dates range tool could be fixed - use the last modified dates. dark mode

Reports. Dashboard. Emails in spam

It would be better if we have option to chat in person

Clearer filter systems. Notifications straight through to email

In the hybrid cards version there is not a way to use the resource filed as a sort/card lane, it would be nice to be able to use this field to view tasks assigned to a resource all in one column/lane. I haven't used the Risk and Issues portion much, but plan to. It seems odd to me that I have to click out to a new section to track these items for a project. I'd like to see the meeting notes enhanced a bit so that you can copy the last agenda forward with unfinished tasks and or action items

Easier quick pay imports. Year end audit reports show inconsequential errors making it hard to review for actual erros

Need alerts and reminders to follow up on open/pending support cases. More user friendly UI. Simpler ways to associate customers with accounts and organizations

Bring in some predictive AI for HTML Example images we can use in the code Detection of errors in coding

I'm not sure if sso is supported

access control. formal outputs. integration to Teams

not of a of room for more complex app requirements

Pharmacies have very little data. Hard to find what you are looking for. Often companies are in multiple industries. This can be confusing.

Automation - moving from one group to another doesn't work sometimes. Limitation of self populating fields

the canned reporting is lacking. both instances where I've used the software we had internal control failures because it allows any combo of controls/transactions without warning. I think the bank reconciliation feature is not easy to use

Connecting seamlessly with SAP ERP. Scheduling the automated jobs

Ability to customize groups within a dashboard. Clearer notifications.

Number of updates have been increased lately. Minor bugs are present (connecting issues). With the new update the last accessed time is inaccurate

Support multiple Extensions in WebEx Calling. Better display and organization of contacts, spaces and teams. Less Crowded

must be very tech savvy to use. can be costly

Better diagnostics. More up to date repository. Better IDE

In my opinion, the email functionality and reliability are dismal. In order to be a CRM, we need reliable capability to track our communications with customers within the email tab. The use of the update section is not as viable since we need to copy and paste missed emails back into the email pane when the system fails to record the email. This one item is the largest complaint for our company. Board item count limitation causes a significant issue for us since we manage tens of thousands of clients. We are unable to keep all of our contacts on one board which increases the complexity of maintaining our contacts. We are also unable to associate an array of items back to clients since each board can only have a small amount of links. monday.com forms which function more like SuperForms would greatly assist our data collection needs.

Easier use of automation for common groups and items. Possibly a column option for each item that shows the last time it has been edited/changed

Would like to have the ability to backup Active Directory directly

the platform can sometime slowdown when you have too many tabs open. notifications could be a bit clearer, option for them to stay on longer. dashboard is not something I personally find useful as it is offered right now

More Granular performance metric tracking is feasible. Ability to restore backups across regions.

Analytics - this needs to be full-featured, cost-effective, and easily provide for inclusion of data from non-SAP SuccessFactors sources. Single data model - even though significant strides have been made in this realm, in my opinion, there is still a long way to go. Prettier UI that might be modifiable to reflect customer web standards

Onboarding 1.0 makes rehires difficult to process as it creates a new file id. Data syncing is not always seamless. There shouldn't be multiple ways to change data as it makes it confusing for our testers (ex. take action button vs. pencil button)

Provisioning access is required for certain functions that customers should be able to do for themselves.

decentralized administration. Automatic security protocols instead of manual overrides

I wish we could toggle between versions without replacing. Can be hard to track changes. Sometimes the notifications don’t show up

Recommended gfs options to get someone new off the ground

Reporting functionality is "clunky". Systemwide outages have occurred. Call answering not always quick (i.e. call drops before you can grab it)

In my opinion, UI is really bad

Interface advancements. Notification bugs. Integrations with Airtable??

Small ease of use improvements, e.g., colored root folders. Multi-Topic review assignments/Topic section reviews.

Turnaround time: Sometimes my emails can go unanswered for a week or so and it requires us to follow-up. However, when we've needed Support, their support team is extremely responsive.

Exporting general ledger details in a format better tailored to sorting, filtering, pivoting

Updating attendee info - without access to my clients full account, I get stuck and can't update an email or incorrect spelling. People are constantly skipping hotel and/or airline requests. Make a report that pulls absolutely every single thing collected in a website

Should have month wise visibility of data

Deployment process to DXP. Release notes summarized with potential features/patches having an impact on the day-to-day work. Easier access to bug fixes recently released.

Reassigning a manager to an employee when the original manager resigns/ is terminated. Ability to drag any field in Dayforce into a custom report. Make onboarding less complicated to set up

The learning curve is steep, and I think the build procedures might be challenging at first because we are transitioning from a non-systematic data management perspective. My team and I believe that its integration into learning new capabilities is complicated and limiting in terms of customizing reports.

Formatting on Cards can be cleaned up- Things like bullets, numbering, etc. The ability to highlight in different colors. Possible API connections?

More levels of sub questions

Fast preview of video files

A cheat sheet or section help me making use of models more easier. Valuable series or learning sections which can diversify the usage of each option. Standards and sample case studies which can help in building LLMS

Not enough coverage on certain brokerage reports like Nephron research. Tagging internal employees to call for attention amidst colleagues. Emailing documents and important information into the system.

sometimes automations can be tricky to set up. sometimes we forget to switch workspaces to find boards. not enough color options to customize stuff

Organizational chart export. Training and Development Reporting

I think this might be unique to my laptop, but sometimes it can take up to five minutes to connect. So if we can improve connection time, that would be great.

I think the look of it could be upgraded to be more up to date software.

Processing time application. Errors when creating reports

Reporting. Analytics

Sometimes on Access Scan can use a lot of processing power

I am please with iFax and have no recommendations for improvement

HRIS integration. Expanded modules

The initial configuration and setup from purchase to goLive was a struggle.

We have not had any issues that would cause us to wish they would do anything differently.

Reclassification of Paid Items. Bank Feed

Better GDPR compliance. Better documentation on Edge vs Web. Better compatibility with GTM

Some of the administrative/security configuration with Windows Active Directory can be tricky when managed by separate corporate IT personnel (alignment in strategy). User adoption with any new process can be challenging, but overall user friendly menus. As Database sizes grow (200,000+ records) paging through records can be cumbersome, probably need to migrate to an archive process to offload some of the data.

Better GUI interface. Currently, [the] performance of FS7200 can't be monitored through TPC/SC, this should be considered to include in [the] future. IBM primarily lacks in designing its products physical looks, should have designed more intrusive and attractive design. A first impression of the product creates [an] impressive opinion.

Topic category listings and updates. General updates

The UI is clunky, resulting in a frustrating UX. It often freezes, resulting in lost work. We experience seemingly random failures that result in lost work. It is not a great sandbox experience for novice users, which is generally the case for the people executing tasks with the software

Share workflow with clients/partners without sharing the whole board. Automation with respects to what is left to be done by exporting data

Expensive. Not suitable for small business. Difficult to integrate with Non SAP products

Sometimes the "unknown results" can be over 30%

Interface is not user-friendly.

Send reminders for task that have deadlines. If monday.com could sync with our lending platform to ensure check amounts match that would be great. A summary of what a workspace is about would be nice

The platform itself is very feature-rich. One of the difficulties we find is that to do things, for example, in terms of monitoring and obtaining data, it's not consistent. There are multiple interfaces to get them, but you can't get the same data through all interfaces. So you end up having to try to find either the least common denominator or we have to build our own code that then mines through all the interfaces and that becomes very problematic. The other problem we've found is that there are issues where the same amount of expected software quality isn't really there in all releases. Cisco breaks things out by like shorter or long-lived release trains. And the long-lived release trains tend to have good quality by the time you get to the second or third release within it. But then those are skips. There are like 12, 18 months skips in between those. So if you start releasing features on versions in between there practically to be safe, you have to wait until you know much later. So to be able to see new future capabilities as they come out and deploy those readily needs to improve, it needs to be much faster.

Need to improve the report. User Manuals

Better mobile app experience. Better reminders for expiring articles. Improved speed

Could be cheaper

Landscape sprawl - can be become quite large do to infrastructure requirements

Housing of external files such as policies

The training can be quite complex, so it would be nice to have canned presentations that users could refer back to for refreshers on some of the advanced techniques for mining account information or running complex searches. Some smaller or non-cabinet level accounts have only basic information available so some of those accounts could use a bit more focus.

Make it easier to group reports. Streamlining of entity information. Esp. what information goes on checks. more clarity on user permissions

UX design. Dynamic roadmaps. Integration with company emails for tagging

The calendar view can be difficult to see everything unless you select specifics.

Icon and image library experience. Intregration with analytics within the platform. Syncing within 3rd party apps

There should be an option to set up different columns for different groups within the same board

Revenue Recognition

I don't fully understand the tasks tab. I don't fully understand the annoucements tab. I don't fully understand the mentions tab

Varity in the content. Integration with Google. Reporting capability. New product need more testing before rollout

Data blending from different data sources is something we may find useful and i believe Kyvos is looking at introducing this in a future release

I wish there was a way to auto-populate the date column within a group so that there's one item for every day of the month. Sometimes I wish there were more color options - or that you could use custom colors. I wish monday.com could directly integrate with every major social platform to eliminate the need for a service like Hootsuite or Sprout Social.

low volume queue forecasting. reporting. shift bids

More up to date equipment.

Ability to customize each workspace home overview page. Ability to add attachments to multiple cards all at the same time. On team page be able to view by the new sorting option of with done dependencies. When adding teams to a workspace, being able to add more than one at a time. Have a pop up if someone completes a card before prior dependencies are complete, asking if sure should be done?. Ability to chose and add multiple documents to multiple cards at same time

Ceipal can improve better things in internal db to get the exact resume there. If it provides Mexican and Canadian candidates that would be better.

No way to contact after hours. This is critical when $11k was erroneously deducted from my account without notice. They apparently re-ran several payroll periods 'accidentally'

Easier to find SAP notes. Better keyword association when searching notes. Organize notes in a better format

The layout of the page is not great. I can't tell where to click to see my commission. I can only see commissions from specific months, rather than for an entire quarter. The graphics that show your numbers don't always reflect the actual sales that you see when you click into the graphic

Transport between system instances is not automated. Licensing Metric for WFA, Onboarding, Recruiting

The mobile app, while functional, was considered somewhat limited. Users desired more features and the ability to perform a wider range of tasks on the go. User who need of inventory management wanted more advanced features and customization options. Some users experienced delays in customer support response times, particularly during peak periods. Improved support responsiveness was a common request. Some users experienced delays in customer support response times, particularly during peak periods. Improved support responsiveness was a common request.

In my experience, horrible customer service. Hidden renewal clause

Create more structured templates. Have tabs enabled to review multiple boards in one ecosystem. More detailed project checklist; gantt features

AWS instance downtimes. Ease of use. End user installation

Templates. formating

Simplify setup of parameters for notification. Currently, it is a cafeteria plan. pick and choose from a host of them. I would rather have the option to choose "don't bug me" or "fill my inbox with alerts" and a few in between choices. In my opinion, quietly update and improve. In my opinion, don't act like every month is a WOW! update. Support for MDM, setup and administration of iOS devices. In my experience, I'm using a separate service now, and not satisfied with the results. I believe this is in the works but not launched yet. I would be willing to guinea pig for them. For every laptop we have out there, using Atera, we have iPads and iPhones as well.

The process of getting the monthly trial balance ready for the flux analysis could be improved. Right now, that is cumbersome. It may be because we use QB Desktop. The home page is still a little overwhelming to look at when one has a lot of entities. But FloQast is continually making upgrades and changes, so I expect this will continue to improve

More training videos are always nice. More in depth quizzes built into the training content

System OS Recognition. Firmware Bundle Compatibility/Bug Checks. More robust support for contract management

Rank tracking does not work very well and doesn't provide as much information as competitors. Backlink analysis is not very intutive. Data isn't always accurate for some of my competitors

First complex set up is a bit hard without explanation. Large gap between the use of Portainer on local and once it's used by a group. Good for people without knowledge on Docker and K3s, but hard for them to set it up

Media asset management. File storage. Short links to pulses

One of the problems that we particularly have and would love to see a lot of improvements with is the we use cloud manager for deployments. Specifically with the managed services, we have a lot of issues with the fact that it is one pipe and one pipeline. So if we do a deployment, we have one thing at a time and you have to wait for one batch and one deployment to go through. So typically if you push one thing through the stage, you have to wait and then it goes to prime, and then if you have another batch that you need to send up, you usually typically have about an hour or four hours wait while everybody's doing validation and then it has to go to production. So we need to find a way to either have multi pipes or multi-stage ability to be able to get more things staged or ready to go or be able to have a better deployment mechanism to get things into production because that wait time and that it's just the cycle is just hard.

The boards can be slow at times depending on the size and scale. adding notes to certain areas seems unintuitive

Project Work Plan assignments with Outlook (bi-directional). Utilization reporting accessible to Team Member license. Time approvals should be routed to a queue for approvers vs. all available to Owners, Resource Managers and Admins

recently with new S4 hana use, there came a lot of integration areas. more simplified add-on tool can become helpful. Creation of Raw material data if can be used in a more interactive way

I used to have issues getting fast responses for equipment quotes but now we have our own account manager. She is absolutely awesome and we all consider her part of our team. By far the best vendor partner we've ever worked with. We all love [..]!. There are times when we just don't have enough installation techs to handle many projects at once. It would be great if AVI-SPL had labor resources that we could call in to augment our staff on these occasions. Just having a few extra skilled hands that we could manage along with our internal staff would be a great help when we need it.

Further customization of auto-actions would be beneficial

ability to leave an RDS off for more than 7 days

There's no option to edit a response to a live Q&A or Poll. There's no Keynote integration on mac. I love Slido, it is easy to use and integrate, but I'd like to see more customization options.

Item deprecation is an issue for us (calibrated items coming up for calibration, SOPs up for review). Because it is a web-based system, it is prone to the usual web-based bugs. Hitting the "back" key in the browser instead of the on-screen back button usually locks up the form and requires you to back all the way out and start over. Initial setup. Because our initial setup was so customizable, and done by employees who are no longer with the company/had differing views of what they wanted from the system, we were left with quite a mess to clean up. Not sure how I would go back in time to fix this besides make sure there were less voices in the room, and more out-of-the-box solution selections.

User management could use improvment - I wish there was an option to deactivate a user rather than completely deleting them. the ability for users to invite external users to the platform is a concern for our Information Security team, it would be great if that feature could be turned off. More reporting options!!!

In the PO matching queue, there is some clunkiness surrounding updating PO lines. For example, if you need to delete PO lines picked up from the invoice, you currently have to delete each line individually, instead of being able to select multiple and delete. Sometimes PO numbers do not properly pick up from the OCR system. For example, the OCR might pick up "PO 18535" instead of "18535". This causes the AP team to have to manually link the PO, creating an extra step. For PO-backed Invoices that require you to manually type in the PO amount, there is no option to save your inputs. If there are any changes to the match details (i.e. linking another PO, or unlinking a PO) all inputs are reset to blank. If there are non PO line items for an invoice that is in the PO matching queue, there is no option to select a separate department code for that line item.

Work and Assignments module - this module can be enhanced to have auto scheduling features and ability to copy and paste tasks from spreadsheets etc. Standard tools to bulk import data into Planview via spreadsheets; currently customization is required. Options to configure ROI metrics calculations, especially with IRR calculations. Updates to Timesheet reporting module; show the schedule hierarchy on the screen instead of hover text.

It could make setting up AD sync easier. I would like the ability to assign training to individual users instead of making them part of a group by clicking on them.

Need better tutorials

Navigation of the solution

Technical White Papers. API documentation. Customer Support

Automated emails - I like having them, but sometimes a user makes a change and it sends LOTS of emails

New hire on boarding can be easier. Report creating can be more user friendly. Auto integration with 401k provider.

Display information in a graph environment

Job title promotion inputs. Integrated modules. Roll up hierarchy. Speed. Reporting. Analytics. Security. Data quality

Connectors into other project mgmt tools. We constantly work with vendors who don't use monday.com and, for obvious reasons, will only use their tool. We need a bridge between the two. Not just one way, update on the side, let it update something real-time on our monday.com board. MS Project and Wrike are examples.

During implementation, I believe that the ICs need to have more conversations with the clients about current processes and changes that the clients would like to make. This would help the configuration process run a lot more smoothly. Communication amongst their own configuration/implementation team members- sharing documents, information, etc. Share more best practices with the clients during implementation.

Cash Management

In my experience, terrible communication. In my experience, extremely slow. In my experience, no recourse for customers when Melio makes errors

Agility. Speed

Veeam replication across sites is complicated and so far we haven't been able to implement it.

UI is basic and can be made more intuitive. Costly (with support). Managing and migrating physical and virtual workloads can be tricky

Better UI for smaller companies. Scaled-down pricing for smaller operations.

I wish that columns could have different titles on the same board. There should be sub/sub catergories

The workload view is not very customizable, for example you cannot collapse the allocation bars to a more condensed view. You cannot create placeholder assignees, like if I wanted to assign a task to a "TBD - Designer" if I did not have a specific individual in mind. Guests cannot even view the workload view

Seems like every couple months you have to provide reviews. Barebones - you have to know how to migrate your site

A brainstorming session on Miro can quickly get messy & cluttered. Some of the solutions they have are a search function and the ability to cut & paste multiple notes into Excel at once. Despite this the grouping & organizing of ideas requires a lot of manual work. If you forget to lock items participants WILL ALWAYS end up moving things they shouldn't. It takes some effort to input images and files. Its easy once you've learned but it does take time for new users. It would be amazing if Miro could take a whole Powerpoint presentation and input the individual slides automatically. Apologies if there is a way to do this.

a Tag overview would be helpful. the Licence Modell is not easy to understand. Release of individual boards without the rest of the boards being visible to this user

They really do a great job and are generally responsive.

Support for more telephone handsets is always welcome

Time to download reports could be enhanced. Incompatible with Excel formats. High costs.

UI can sometimes be challenging to learn and use. Occasional errors with posting. Cost is sometimes seen as too much for our business

option to present 2 tasks at a time

I think training is too intense. training is not in person. features are supposed to be user friendly but often arent

Personal to do list. Reminders. Schedule list

Improved mobile view options. De-bug timed items (which can disappear when mirroring on another board). Text cursor automatically flashing for update boxes, rather than requiring a second click (eg. when opening the pop up for linked files)

Real time updates sometimes take long to reflect when a team is collaborating on monday.com.

No, I think at least compared with other products, this ATTP server is really good.

Recruiting. Position Management

Become more of a messenger system like Slack or GChat. A few basic PM abilities are missing like "days off"

More connections with major software products. EDI feeds with HCM and HRIS systems

Communicating changes in states needs like codes used. Sometimes emails are vague and I don't know if I need to make a change on my end somewhere. The initial setup was unclear. There are some people who were exceptionally helpful like Roger Ingalsbe and some who were not helpful at all.

Table functionality feels quite clunky and limited compared to what's possible in MS Office. Permissions for Miro teams, projects, and boards can be confusing for new users (based on Enterprise version). We often find people need help understanding the difference between sharing a board and sharing an entire team a board, how & why they should use projects, and how to manage project permissions to give access to the right people.

I think the interface could be a little more aesthetically pleasing.

I am very happy with the product. Maybe we could pay a bit less

Hovering between Table cells is not good. Needs to be like Excel instead of Word. Bulk card creation feature is not fast and efficient. Tagging relevant team member in particular areas of the Card will be really helpful. But not present yet.

Simplify the reporting tool

Bluejeans meetings require strong internet connection to conduct business meetings. Bluejeans meetings does not support multiple languages. I like the fact that it has a very nice and very clear video and audio quality.

Audience Journey

For creating dashboard

the Opportunities dashboard was hard to customize for our use case. mandatory color orange interface not my favorite. some bugs (e.g. under "CHOOSE COLUMNS" can't use search bar to find an item)

the cost. the lack of support on new technology like Kubernetes. no docker

Latency. Documentation for new users. More customization needed. Benchamarking to other industries/verticals

More options with look backs for any earnings that affect the regular rate of pay for hourly employees. More options for reporting on detailed labor distribution details. More options for entering bonuses that are not done via Excel import

Tool is little hard to configure so need to be light to save resource consumption. Features are so in-depth that integrated guidance should be available to help the users on how to use. Graphical view can be improved to make it more convenient to understand the data representation.

An area to list where lead was found

As we grow, the pricing of additional modules looks like it will grow quickly. Keeping this low would encourage us to lean into more use cases faster. Changing employee salaries in the UI/UX was difficult the first time we learned how to do it. Expense management could be more automated - Automatically creating filters on approved or unapproved expenses rather than post-hoc review.

load times for bulk actions

Add comprehensive landing page builder. Add drag and drop functionality into emails. Improve UI/UX interface as the current one not very intuitive

Time control for people outside the team. The privacy control of guests could be more intuitive. If the creator of the task is not assigned to it, the @asignees tag won't send a notification to them

Resource usage - By this, I mean that the program could be "tuned" better to run smoother and be more responsive. Sometimes I get the feeling this program is heavier on computer resource usage than it should be. This is especially the case when using it as an integration embedded within another app.

Pull last and pull first from a table of aggregated numbers - this feature seems to break often. Providing a place to link documentation or embed video documentation.

Ability to customize training content

When logging in via a saved bookmark, sometimes it takes you to old data, then you need to click a few buttons to get the page updated again with the latest data. Cost while not over the top, it is still not cheap

Don't love the organization chart and diagram functionality

Plans. One should be able to add different columns headings in the same board

More country based content (Canada)

The available documentation and learning resources are not extensive enough. The tool lacks sufficient customization options for creating and managing test cases. Limited integration with other tools and platforms.

User Education. Outreach Events. Communication with Users

SDK can be improved. UI can be improved

Reporting

Campaign Lists view could handle large volumes of Campaign display better. The Structure of building templates and unsubscribe elements can be confusing

Time to respond to commands for admin side. doesn't work with TMobile

Being able to port data from other applications. More automation. Integrate AI software like chatgpt

Social media integration. Google Analytics integration. Ad performance reporting. Social media reporting

Mobile App is missing features that the web version has. Reinstalling NinjaOne on a PC that had NinjaOne before can be a pain. NinjaOne updates a lot (not bad but sometimes I experience short downtime)

we often experience glitches, preventing our call handlers to answer calls. glitches when logging out of MAX if not done correctly. We are expected to help figure out the reasons behind these glitches or do some for the work needed to fix it ourselves

Supply Chain Optimization. Quality Control

In the past we have lost two account representatives and not been informed in advance that they were leaving. In both cases, we didn't find out the rep was no longer working our cases until after emails had been unanswered for days. would be ideal if email could be sent as a group email to each admin at our company instead of one email per person. Makes it difficult to know who received which email and who didn't.

I have performance issues with the Dashlane mobile app, including slow loading times. Improvements in performance would benefit mobile users. I suggest improvements in the password sharing feature, including more flexible options such as setting time limits on access or providing read-only access for shared passwords. Providing users with more customisation options, such as personalization of dashboards, themes, or organisation of passwords based on individual preferences, could enhance user satisfaction.

Trending topics is an interesting idea, but I haven't yet found much use for it. Improvements with spelling and grammar check

Price

Provide more accurate answers in Ask a question

Call Quality. Workforce Management. System Glitch

Long-term pledge payments. Soft credit/attribution. Dashboard options.

Multi domains could be used in a more simplified way

Notifications

Interactive Invoices. It would be nice to send estimates or invoices that have buttons embedded that clients could approve from there. Their whole CRM emailing side. I know its in Beta but it would be nice to get that working really well.

The onboarding spreadsheet. Ensuring that all existing needs are 100% met. A bit more focused documentation specific to our implementation.

Copying line item details. Planning Maestro is good at copying large swathes of data, but copying single line items could speed up the process of adding new line item details. Speed up the refresh rate of the Analytics Maestro tool

Quiz scoring. Alerts and notifications. Training and Support

Being able to make individual checkbox fields that aren't linked to all the others easily - the process of either copying and then renaming them all individually or else creating a brand new checkbox each time (especially if having to resize it and wanting them all to be consistent) is tedious and time-consuming. The ability of Adobe to 'read' and auto-generate form field boxes off Word/Excel templates - often misses what I would consider quite obvious fields.

AP Automation with multiple entities. Having the ability to see if you've attached a document in the credit card transactions screen without opening up each document. Being able to make AR invoices from any entity instead of just our master entity

Stability. High-Availability. Maintenance without downtime. Linux instead of Windows for the VBR

lag on updates. Some carriers don't show delivery updates on Monday. Sometimes do slow movements on items.

It would be interesting to have the option to separate content for beginner users from complex content for advanced users

Pricing per words instead of uses (invocations).  Mobile app (Android)

Can Improve on making the upload feature easier. Needs to promote their stats function better. Having a built in payroll module would be nice as well.

Dashboards are a bit basic and would be good if it integrated a BI product into it

size of field names and alt structure values needs to be larger. Need to be able to add custom information to the USER records. customer success center tends to be only links. I understand the problem with recreated text, but it does get distracting when I have to click on several links to get to the information that I need. Often, before I get to what I'm trying to find, I get distracted by other links.

Shadow of remote sessions. Health Check on client OS - allow only supported OS if above certain patch level

Allow subitems to take in the due date of the parent item

Integration between platforms like Paycor recruiting. One on one customer support scheduling. Ease of Reporting. Some items seem like they could be useful, but not sure of the purpose - like job descriptions. Process for promotions?

RSC can get out of sync sometimes.

Integration with existing envirnoment is bit complex. Need Improvements in user interface design and user experience. Scalability required for large and complex envirnoment

Low cost training/education platforms needed for small companies/individuals

Pricing for companies with a small but very distributed workforce. Customer service

More analytics/insights on devices. Random authentication requests. Authentication timeouts (due to your device being slower than the next person)

Make image management a little easier to manage

The way the reports are being developed on BI

Miro is very straightforward to use, and I can't think of anything that frustrates or bothers me

Search function is hard to use. Max display row setting impacts max output row. Not easy to get support

I used to be able to "flip" a call from my desk to my cell and vise versa. Don't see that feature anymore. easier way to send text messages to more than one person

Styling of boards

It could expand some drill down capabilities.

overall view of retention. error details from within the dashboard rather than logs

I would love to see some AI features regarding the logic of workflows. When editing a field with standard answers, would be awesome to always have the option to type in to add a new possible standard answer directly within the field itself without having to go edit the property in settings and then go back. Texting functionality at lower price point

The phone app could have a better interface. Add more interaction with other applications. Best native templates

Make the functions a little easier to use (example sum, add, divide, etc). More tutorials. Faster response time from support

Ability to upload mp3 files. Multiple facilitators for one course. Ability to take notes on the platform

Requirement Mapping is one of the challenge. Sometimes the App works very slow. Expensive

Quiz was very hard, it took me twice to pass it, but I have heard some still have not. Seems to be a very difficult set up, I would recommend finding a way to make it more user friendly. The platform is designed to captue most processes. As an OpX guy I would like to see an easy to use sandbox that could be saved and distributed - like a visio stand alone document. Easy to create and allow for great detail to identify opportunities. Otherwise I would not use it for daily use as there is no value stepping through a detailed set up when I am looking to quickly map something.

Lacks predictive analytics for sales forecasting. we are missing this feature to predict customer behavior, sales and lead scoring. this all would help us in decision making. integration complexity, We often face integration complexities with other third party tools such as salesforce. if possible offer pre build connectors that help and ease integeration

Contacts are outdated and no longer with the company. Revenue is not accurate

Connection. Notifications. Organization of schedule.

Some of the menus could be updated and made more intuitive.

The main obstacle we had was that the SAP Customer Data Platform offers numerous products, features, and use cases, so the learning curve was steep, but we were able to adapt to its functionality with the assistance of our account managers.

Custom Reporting. Sometimes takes a while to load new pages. Roles and Workflows - sometimes complex - when trying to expand use case - need for a consultant

Have a more robust email feature. Native connection with Drive. Email Automations

UI. AI. User engagement. New feature. Compete with workday. Mobile features to improve. Integration improvement. Language support in reporting. Good bash boards. Reporting improvements. Expensive

Expenses - Could use a way to track mileage on app while driving. Reporting - Make it easier to make custom reports

The application sometimes falls flat compared to the website. Mirroring boards could be more streamlined. Automations

A lot of their competitors offer freebies, like Google ads credit or 1 year free SSL and stuff like that. I understand that for a small company that's a big cost, but wouldn't hurt for them to enter in a partnership with someone and offer things like this.

More specific filters. More options to find recent searches

Price

10 GE is mandatory, I think in some environment 1 Gbps could be used. Entry ticket is high, but once you growth, it is reduced. Lack of end user laptop support (officially)

Sometimes it takes the remote control agent some time to connect. Reporting could be improved

Migration of backup jobs from one storage option to another would be ideal. More specific information when a backup job has grown excessively compared to other backups over time

communication - project manager didn't contact us for 3 weeks after purchase agreement was signed. more transparency on their purchase agreements with what installation dates will be

Ability to add Comments/Notes with Files. No editing available for files. No Project management capability

Training for managing the console is mostly offered through test-based web pages. You will probably only use a fraction of what KnowBe4 is capable of. When you ask KnowBe4 for knowledge of how to use a feature, they usually send you a link to a text-based webpage that may, or may not solve the issue.

Recruiting. Assistance. A concierge type service to recommend best practices

Lacks a dark mode for users when setting up campaigns. Lots of options but can be overwhelming to find the specific ones you want. Lack of transparency on where AI-created materials come from

It would be nice for some more commonly used email clients to be added to the list of previews as some that we work with are not available.

Easier report to access wrike tasks assigned to you. Too many buttons to choose from and it can sometimes seem cluttered with information you are looking at

Having pay effective date changes. In prior systems I would update a pay with an effective date and that would transfer to the time cards. This system if I update pay the timecards reflect updated pay through the last archived date. Makes it a little confusing. PTO and Hourly rates- the system does not look at a 40 hour work week for hourly employees. If someone has worked 36 hours and then uses 8 hours of PTO on a Friday the system then calculates it as 36 hours regular pay and 4 hours pto. Prior systems would reduce the regular pay to 32 hours and keep PTO at 8. I have to manually change this when I run payroll. Shift premium and PTO/Overtime- If a night shift employee uses PTO on a Friday with the same 36 hours issue, the overtime will go to the day shift rate rather than stay at the night shift time. The system shouldn't be looking at the PTO for OT calculation. Navigating forms. They removed the bar at the top of the page with an arrow/drop down menu to a side bar. The side bar is less efficient in my opinion. I have to click on the bar to be able to change which function I'd like to use. The top navigation was better.

I generally feel that any challenges I experience are due to the vast flexibility the platform has. My gut tells me that my minor issues are actually a result of certain functionality needing to be there to meet the needs of other customers, and it's not Litmos' fault that my specific workflow doesn't fit exactly into their functionality. It's a matter of me determining how I can update my workflow to fit the feature set.

a little learning curve. a litte bit of hard to install if there are problems on the network that arises.

No root access to an RDS instance. MySQL databases max out available storage quickly. UAT and PROD version of identical databases don't allow duplicate naming.

data compression

We can see the bot and the digital side is growing at the moment, but there are still a couple of gaps that we think about. So as I say, every customer comes through our bot, but we don't have an easy way of exporting what they're actually telling us. We can see a snippet throughout the day and we can retrieve, I believe, 250 of the most recent things, but we get about 3,000 calls a day. It's a snapshot of what we're actually getting. It's the analytics piece that we'd like to see enhanced a bit.

Some of the page layouts are clunky, especially the crew list page. LASSO Crew has a calendar feed that can link to gcal, iCal, etc but it’s very limited and doesn’t reliably update the calendar when the schedule changes. I would like it to push automated clock-in/clock out alerts to my team. I can set these up manually by scheduling messages but it is a very cumbersome process.

Loading files preview. Tags for projects. Color folders

Differently. Integration with custom built data science models, that would be beautiful. It isn't that like things like Sensei are not good. They're very good, but they're black box. And so if there's a suggestion that's given and it's wrong, it's not defensible. So if it allowed an open architecture or some type of integration with Python or R models, Jupiter Notebooks, other kinds of things that would augment what it generates that would allow a concept of challenger versus champion models to compete. And to understand, that way you can almost like test yours against theirs and improve that way.

integration of multiple services. some udf should be provided on it. costing is little high.

Churn scores are tough to nail down. You really have to be a pro and know the ins and outs of each feature to get full usage. Code

They could help us setup our company better since we have a subscription. They could do routine overviews of client accounts to see where we can be more efficient with their products. This may bring you more money if you know of something we could use better. 1 client rep not a whole team of random reps

More updates from the accounts grid view. Ability to restrict sub roles by entity. ability for users to use if then logic on import definitions

Advanced editing possibilities in template

integration with other tools. notifications. costs

More merchants. Marketing activations from brands. Better discount rates at select long tail brands

Limited Query flexibility in comparison to SQL. Expensive for huge workloads. Complexity increases as workloads increased, making it difficult to optimize. Data size limitations

Color and shape differentiation. General user interface could be more accessible. For larger organizations, Miro is only accessible through Teams or other third-party applications. Having an extension through which it is connected but can operate outside of teams would be beneficial

Setting up your work space and boards initially can be a bit confusing. Also it's not as great on mobile

integrate AI for formulas

Usability and User Experience. Customization and Flexibility. integration and compatibility. Enhance Machine learning and Analytics

More possibilities to use Topdesk on mobile devices. On the operator side a search engine which searches over all modules

Details explanation of the error when validate the transactions can be provided rather than a short error code or phrase that can reduce the time used for fixing the transactions. It could invest in more comprehensive training resources to minimize the time it takes for user to become proficient users of the platform. Improving the ability to handle non-standard transactions or exceptions that can enhance its effectiveness.

Sometimes, we may wish to take it back, which is not possible. The accumulated score does not reset over a period of time.

At this time only one CRM integration is allowed, Salesforce or D365 or others. However, you can use APIs to send data from more than one system so you can still bring in that data.

Folders containing many blocks can cause significant performance issues. Updating the underlying technology for Find could open up doors to more modern search solutions.

Firstly, their user interface is outdated and can be upgraded to meet the new age. Also, reduction in software upgrade time, it is often time-consuming. The reporting functionality requires a new age upgrade too.

Ability to create & access in app reporting. Better administration of setting up & updating user access to boards

Need to improve in call centre environment. Able to see who is on the call. Need to have detail system log

Report Building is a VERY time intensive module. You cannot "find" your way through any report building with Sage Intacct. You must be taught and even then, you may need professionals to build the reports for you. Sage Intacct is not intuitive or user-friendly, there is a basic level of training that needs to happen as opposed to other programs that walk you through as you go and intuit needs and save info. Everything in Sage Intacct is a deliberate choice.

An easier way to share information between users. A way to allow for multiple administrators

I'd like to see it ring to just one main line and then hop to the phone tree after three ring no answer. I wish the texting option was online a bit faster, this would alleviate our need to keep using work mobile phones. I think the various training courses could be organized a bit better - it was a bit confusing to figure out the order to take the courses, where to find them, and such

Pricing. Limited Query Capabilities. Global Tables Complexity

Introducing it to beginners. Ability to stay logged on from multiple devices. App response speed on iOS can be better

The Cisco Meraki product line and especially the MXs is great in their functionality where they make it really easy to use and really simplify a lot of things. I do feel that some of the more advanced features that some bigger organizations really need are lacking the ability to still have access to a command prompt to do custom configurations and stuff like that.

Planview Integration with Power Apps is area of improvement. Planview Trainings need to be more frequent

Clarity on what locations are included. Merged views - several markets combined

Maybe some sort of icon addition/highlighted text in the sidebar that denotes projects/tasks assigned to me? It would be great to see that at a glance rather than clicking through the projects.

I think the color on the product, maybe changing it or having a cause when you put it in a rack and then all you have is silver ones, you know, maybe some type of different color scheme, that way you pull ahead. I don't know, just like a simple face plate change that you can change out for look, kind of.

Implementation. Help on Sage's side. More training.

Experro can provide advanced analytics features within the platform to gain deeper insights into website performance and user engagement. While Experro offers a range of powerful features, there are a couple of areas where I see potential for improvement. Firstly, its frontend template library is somewhat limited; it could provide a wider variety of options. Experro currently lacks automation capabilities, which could significantly eliminate manual efforts.

Astra DB might be difficult to understand for people who are unfamiliar with Apache Cassandra. Improving the initial experience for newcomers, as well as offering better documentation and lessons, might be advantageous. The Astra DB ecosystem may be enhanced by expanding the ecosystem of plugins, integrations, and community-contributed solutions.

I honestly can't find anything wrong with KnowBe4.

Misleading offers. Poor customer response. lack of follow-up

The SAP CDP dashboard shows real-time results and data for each campaign, but the information is a bit difficult to understand without more context or explanation. Since we often rely on consultants to explain the numbers to us, I would appreciate if the dashboard were a little easier to understand on our own.

more or better benefit options; like UHC. better pricing on benefits

Flexibility and customization in GIF Flows in Help Portal. More themes or capability to upload our branding themes in portal. Ability to Parse Email Parameters link Phone and Address from the raised ticket or other custom tracking event

diferent column structure in diferent groups at the same board

The program can run pretty slowly at times

in general, just having better and the most up to date information on a company or its employees.

I would say quality management. At the moment with the Genesys product, in order to be able to use data linked to the evaluation of interactions, we need to first build a whole data architecture with APIs, from Genesys to an external database. We need to do all of that in order to be able to extract feedback that we can give to agents. By investing more in the availability of feedback, we'll be able to quickly cascade important information and improve our level of service.

Would be great to be able to share a larger version with people without Miro accounts. Better presentation mode. More boards

Language translations

Onboarding 2 and ECP

We can get online experience and user behavior patents on websites and apps, but it doesn't stitch the data to something we want. We wanted to stitch the online data to in-store sales data or just the 360 view of customers is one of the lags and Adobe doesn't also have a DEXA analysis. It's more like heat mapping to see how users tend to navigate within the page. We use Adobe Analytics mainly for page loads and clicks on the website, but we don't know like zonings and things like that on the page. Adobe Analytics doesn't have the ability to integrate with other solutions, like in-house solutions, such as data platforms and data lakes, and where we want to bring in data into Adobe when it's a huge data set.

Better time tracking system for time spent on projects

Overseeing project progress. Resource allocation - seeing staff workloads. Some reports are lacking

Chat notifications can easily be missed because alerts and notifications do not always appear

Expanding to provide use cases for specific orgs. AI incorporation

Mobile dashboard is missing. local language support. cost considerations

When we upgraded to Enterprise, it would be great if we would be able to get Agent UI. The current version does not have the best front-facing functionality.

Mobile experience. Asset organization. Notifications — standalone page, customizable email templates…

More automation in uploading payments

No training. I am just learning as I go. Too many reports to streamline. Suppose you could narrow down the options.

Make a way to go to a true full screen view. Don't automatically go to my inbox on startup. Easier way to organize/shape rows and columns.

For features that clients are generally going to 3rd party vendors, it would be nice if SuccessFactors could develop that more on their own. This would help from a cost perspective to organizations that might be affiliated with the public sector or non-profit to get best use out of the system while still maintaining cost effectiveness

Presentation transcribing. PDF viewer.

As per my experience till now, no areas of improvement. But would definitely like to share feedback again if i come across any such area where improvement is required in the future.

Creating reports from scratch using report designer requires an advanced knowledge of the program and is too time consuming

There is a feature within groups where an admin of a group can add a resource, but cannot pin the resource. Only the hub admin can go in to pin the resource. It would be preferable to allow group admins to perform that function.

I think training and ease of use. There's a very large learning curve. I think getting some of our marketers up and running on Marketo takes typically a very long process just to get them fully trained on even just sending emails. It's one of the more difficult ESPs I've ever used. It functions great and it has a lot of features available, but just learning all of those features takes a lot of time. I'm a power user and I've been on the product for six years now and there's still a lot about the product that I don't know and that I'm still learning. So I think you just have to have a very technical mindset to be able to use the product when a lot of people are more marketers and just not used to doing some more customizable really tech oriented roles.

the merger the call. can not define whom is calling

Slow or lags and seems to have issues but they are communicated when things happen. Have the ability to create Folders in Folders for different projects under the same client. Automation seems to fail and has to be reset even if it shows as being active still

More individual adaptation abilities within user access

In my experience, setup of program is very cumbersome. Multiple Consultants sessions are required at an additional cost to demonstrate how it could be setup. A more in-dept, strategic approach would be better then try and see approach. Programming changes to the program cause issues in daily usage. In my opinion, Support is lacking. Tickets can be submitted but many times the issue is not clearly understood. I think it would resolve issues more quickly to speak with someone rather than weeks of back and forth.

can be slow to load leads. i would like to be able to see what other people are doing on there like in other spreadsheets

Would be nice if the linux bits did not complain as much about wanting to be immutable. Would be nice to have a backup method for the main backup server to be able to restore from a data location like any other machine. It would be nice if things would be a little more integrated into one client vs. having a client for backup, client for veeam one, enterprise manager, etc.

More custom and advanced features

HR&Payroll. Can't future date things or it will impact current payroll. In my experiene, cannot manipulate or customize Performance Management as much as I want to. When I future assign some annual reviews, they don't always get launched by the system. Customer Service. When I call in, they don't always know what they're talking about. I don't usually trust their answers. Our benefits are through Bswift, a third party subsidiary that integrates with Paylocity. These two departments don't talk to each other and will often send me on a wild goose chase to see who is handling what.

Not cost-effective. Not an easy integration. Not user-friendly

Would love to see monday.com integrate with my CRM

Communication notifications. Email triggers/business rules. Customizing UI to allow for branding

Provide network access for users. Segregate network traffic. Manage secure access for authorized users and devices

Control performance can be improved, specially for .Net. Reporting controls can have ML algorithms inbuild into them

having subitems mirror the item in terms of columns and data

Litmus goes through previews too quickly, doing full sets in builder when you need to focus on just one platform. Litmus could offer preview for web browsers. Litmus plug in for Salesforce should be supported on all plans

automatic updates for interface program ( free layout plus)

It is not very intuitive, took a bit of a learning curve. It can be somewhat wonky to edit the colors and layout of templates. The Mac hand gestures on the track pad and be a little off. Takes a particular touch to navigate well.

AI Writing: This is a new feature, and in comparison to alternatives it's poor both from a pricing and result perspective. Monthly Pricing: Surfer used to a clear value for money solution, it's somewhat pricing out solo-operators with the current pricing model. Backlinks: Surfer does have a backlink crawler, but it's quite limited

Lowered Cost. Scalability

syncing the calendar from outlook to managing it from monday.com. escorting the monday.com main user for better implementation at the organization. more guidence for users with automation or any other usage of the platform and all the aspects of the technyc every-day usage

Documentation. Build more ready to user features on React UI

Faster output time. Local characters (Vietnamese, Tamil). Support more file formats.

Integration with apps such as Adobe Creative Suite

Integration with On-Prem. Access to more APIs in the apps section. Improving API actions.

It's hard finding new people with the required knowledge. It seems expensive.

The dashboards are helpful as a group, individually we don't use them. Probably just an extra, but with AI, how can Ai be used to improve the platform?. Be cool to have Wrike be our one stop platform for everything. We currently use slack, for communication, and zoom for video calls.

it works fine for what I need it do do

More content at the lower tiers. You shouldn't have to pay for the highest tier to get the best content. Default Dashboard should be to the training content for all users. Admins should have to choose to see the Admin Dashboard should they need that view. Users should be able to enter more information on their own. Currently the admin has to update any phone number or organizational information instead of the user doing it.

task ordering by priority (I think partly possible in table view but very clunky). seeing information on a history of status changes and who applied these for all users. less frequent design updates that completely reshape the UX

They are unable to fix about anything through their tech support. They can't go into the backend of their program to see what you experience which makes for a lot of back and forth and them rarely ever being able to address a support issue. Not compatible with Safari for published training and have to go through an app with smartphone. Login emails unreliable..over 25% of my users constantly reported not getting them or they go to spam; not sure why, but on other platforms I've used this has never been an issue.

Probably the business model overall, if you sign up for content syndication, this is a database building exercise, you can't contact these leads as oddly they don't remember the content they've downloaded

Free trial is very short. Pricing plans are hard to understand. Mobile app could be better

Planning Instagram layout. Creating Facebook albums. Facebook events

issues between Sage Intacct and integration with Salesforce specially with billing

UI can be improved. Easy usable SDK

Will be a bit difficult for someone who doesn't know CQL. Complex queries will be a challenge to perform. Will take some time to get used to if you're new to distributed systems.

Limited Reporting. Doesn’t integrate with Microsoft

Calibration of number specific ratings could be added with a big scale. We use EXEL to fill this need. Would like to add company-wide goals and tie them to my individual performance goals. Performance and goal evaluation functionality that is more focused on operators and shop floor workers

Little more flexibility with the employee self service for employees who refuse to use it.

A bit more flexibility in the chat functionality. Users expect emoji reactions and replies because they have been trained by Slack and WhatsApp. Clearer structure and information about what falls under each price plan

Sometimes scheduled posts fail to send. Copy customization across accounts, not just channels type

API for comunication (WhatsApp). Employee points. Real time actions ( doing a task directly at monday, like ¨share screen¨)

clarity in how to add people on boards

Automation could be improved. Reporting. Custom Icons. More functionalities in custom fields

Clawbacks can be confusing. handling of exceptions

A GUI for Linux would be welcome.

Uploaded graphics could be easier to view and access for future use. Email campaign editor could use some improved UI and functionality. Tools, features and functions can be a little hard to figure out on your own the first time through

Interaction with Teams, it is improving but would like more. Analyzing input on a board to group say postits and create word clouds of other form of analytics based on what is present. Improve adaptation journey, it isn't bad but would need a bit more

Cloud Payroll. SF owned Benefits Module. complex Time Management System

Succession planning. 360 reviews. Employee listening surveys

Nothing as such. Tool needs maturity

the only thing I wish that Veeam would do is the ability to combine all services in one platform. We have another backup solution we use for on prem backups to an offline cloud backup source. I wish Veeam had a solution like this, they are implementing Azure resources for backups currently and store in AWS so there is a separation of where data is stored and is offline with ransomware protection. Maybe one day.

Miro app requires a lot of computer resources. SSO authentication is not easy

Automations, specifically regarding connect boards. Multi-select too has a 500 limit which is frustrating. We have had to use PowerBI because of monday.com's limited reporting functions.

Animation (would love to be able to record and play animation back)

The way analytics are set up can be a bit confusing and clunky. Not being able to target things in the email flow (eg custom objects, etc). Marketo send times can delay quite a bit at times

automation for tags. faster loading time for widgets, views, dashboards. more automation for due dates/overdue dates to increase visibility into completion rates

Integration with 3rd party systems. Workflow customisations should be simpler. Code Changes and deployment workflows should simplified

Difficult to identify which text to reuse if the text is used in many places. Filter columns in a table

Just one issue is some of the buttons or icons I have to guess what they do

Product Development

During the open enrollment period, they are unreasonable about next year's benefit information. It would be nice if the payroll information would be updated immediately upon completing the payroll process instead of the next day.

Reporting is based on the assumption that end-users will log into the web-friendly tool, so it does not currently provide export capabilities to all user classes as well as email report functionality. Resource inventory reporting is limited to certain services and certain fields; however, Apptio seems to be working to develop out this solution more. Rightsizing is limited to EC2, RDS, EBS, S3, and Redshift. It would be nice to see ELB, Gateways, and other services identified for optimization. Limited ability to track custom savings opportunities within the tool so that you can build KPI's off progress or lack of progress.

Provide better ways to be able to access raw data from the platform without the need of APIs or custom reports. With more and more users working remotely, have the platform more friendly with Wifi connections. A lot of connection and audio issues occur due to being connected to the internet via wifi. It's not ideal for everyone to be connected via ethernet cable. Have the ability to get contact detail reports past 90 days.

upload speed. can't pause the backup on one pc and restart it on another

Currently there is nothing I would change.

Live user support. Providing relatable user cases for a company. Helpful user hints within each interface (instead of within community)

Being able to modify who gets alerts. I have different jobs setup and I don't need everyone getting alerts that don't pertain to them. Better support with the SQL plugin TOOL. Seems to need more documentation on it. Being able to join a call rather then emailing back and forth

Costing. Mobile Engagement. Customer Behaviour Reports

Lagging of information. Errors within onboarding. Reporting functionality

Could be faster

Cost is really high and pricing models are not flexible for small scale organization. Limitations in terms of customizing reports and dashboards in case the organization has unique requirements. Integration with other systems related to payroll or databases is quite complex where users face difficulties with data mapping and consistency

Additional automation I would like to see includes adding sublines automatically when something happens. Allowing groups in one board to have different fields. Dashboard - ability to get more granular with data (time to fill by recruiter etc)

Pricing can be made simpler. More integrations can be added

Finding users/machines could be easier. Rather use an authenticator thank 2fa

I can't recall right now what some of the specific details were. But I do know that whenever our team member that manages monday.com reached out for help, he got it!

Would like to be notified when tasks are ready for review. Need more visibility into what templates are available and how they work best. Would like to have a way to force preparers to review system certified recons at least 2x a year

Better visual interface. Speed

Units of measurement

Calling the text. Robot voice of text to landlines, not mine. Opt Out, landline, can't receive needs more detail

SAP Learning doesn't have a very robust reporting capability- which is necessary for a regulated industry such as Biotech/Pharma. Reports, that are easily accessible and provide the information necessary for audits is critical. However, it does not offer that easily.

Customizability by individuals. integration to google calendar (if not available)

Physically moving posts around the calendar was a bit janky

It would help if we could nest files and folders more. Would be nice if it had more editing capabilities. Would be great if structure would be more similar to other word processors

Photo crop tool doesn’t always work correctly. More folder organization would be nice. Hashtag recommendations would be nice

It is quite costly solution compared to others. some features need detailed documenatation. except above 2 points everything is fine

Time format. Being able to customize layout and appearance

Sometimes some other country clients are not able to give the outputs as the language issue. So if translator type thing can be modified into an existing one. Mobile app is not that much effective to use as per my experience. Miro can be modified into a more user-friendly application in terms of sticky note size,how to write n how to place how to organize the flows

Invoices tracking. Currency tracking. Persona tracking

Loom can definitely join the AI trend and evolve the system to do other things and support businesses. Loom can improve service quality, it happens sometimes that we record videos and these do not work or don't move past the processing phase. Better storage and user experience when navigating previous videos. we rarely use it and i think they can do more with it. Like building company spaces or something.

More data exposure/insights available via the interface. Scheduled reporting functionality within the Enterprise SKUs. Improved service integration capabilities in services that have been in play for some time (Google)

update user interface. combine some features to make it easier. use AI to understand the process

More customization with text and placement. Better folder organization. Easier to read fonts and folders

A web-based client would be nice. Price could be more affordable.

Usermodel. Pricing

Setting up for the first time will take time - possibly more setup wizards for jobswould help

This is more a user problem, but I find I can have very messy miro boards, and at times I'm not sure the best way to organise them - have everything in one project or create several projects for different tasks?. I would like the ability to add larger images, as at times I have screenshots of web pages and Miro doesn't accept them past a certain pixel dimention.

Missing a “Notes” function for keeping track of notes. Missing a messaging function to send messages that aren’t related to a specific work item. Missing ability to automate project status updates based on specific custom item types

Unless you had a primary user license, notifying the support team of an issue during a webinar was difficult. Recording audio slide to slide for on-demand webinars was sometimes wonky.

First-time users can be a bit overwhelmed. Incorporating a new database can be easier.

I'd like to have the ability to purchase 4K without having to ramp up the subscription to the next level. I only need 4K but none of the other features of the next level plan.

Easier navigation to undo mistakes. Easier to use dashboard widgets

Schedule page can be a little easier to navigate. Having the option to be on a waitlist on the app so it can be added to your schedule if you can go in to the session. Have the option to use Face ID to get into app after initial login.

The interface is a bit overwhelming. I'd to see that streamlined.

The only improvement could be the interface

We had a bug present for many months before a fix was implemented. Better integration with Azure functionality would be a plus

I get notifications for every thing.

Cost. It could offer more advanced content personalization options. For instance, the ability to dynamically generate content blocks within emails or landing pages based on a lead's specific interests or past interactions would take personalization to the next level

Cosmetics changes on the Invoices even if the books are closed

The support team need to be proactive. There are many occasion where professional service team and TBA have disconnect. Little more branding and focus on customer satisfaction will be added advantage

option to remove Default templates to avoid committing errors. Once we modify the invoices with minor changes without impacting the invoice value, once again we need to book the revenue if the period is open in system. Can have more reports that can be modified

It's quite expensive. So many old user are there who're not available in the market. Strings are hard to build

It is a multi-step process to see to-do list. Hard to identify key initiatives from lower priorities at a glance. Filtering projects is unclear. Searching initiatives requires too much specific knowledge of what you’re looking for

Would love the ability to break certain board down into sub sub items. Can sometimes crash and cause loss of data while inputting information. Sometimes if two or more people are updating a board at the same time, it will not update in real time for the other users and we end up doing double work

Changes have been made to the licensing model, and it has not always been clear to us how these changes affect our usage and costs. It would be beneficial if Veeam could provide more detailed and user-friendly information about licensing terms, pricing structures, and any modifications to ensure that users have a clear understanding of what is required and what they are entitled to. Improved transparency in this regard would help us effectively plan and budget for our data management needs and reduce any potential confusion or uncertainty surrounding licensing.

Recruitment. Integration with salesforce

"My Work" doesn't need to contain all the canceled items - makes it confusing. Subitems in lists are sometimes visibly unappealing - unsure how to fix this one. Calendars - we use for social media- if I accidentally click off the box while I'm typing it erases all the information, and I have to start completely over

BOT automation on updating of attributes. Interface

While the product has many strengths, one area that could be improved is allowing multiple users to edit a page simultaneously.

0 day local retention of VMs. It keeps atleast one copy of VM on local brik. No way to assign a specific encryption key for a specific VM. Some Disk Consolidation and Deduplication issues.

It would be nice to convert an email into a task in monday.com

Needing to click through layers to edit nested blocks seems inefficient. Projects can get messy as it is easy for unintended items to get added to a project. Shared blocks are a great feature, but we run into issues where users use a block not understanding that it is shared and edit the block, resulting in wrong content in sections of the site.

Grainularity. Access cli on web ui. More clear way on creating custom dynamic applications

Content management - aging of documentation. Organization and representation of boards - hundreds of boards are hard to manage

Credit card donations don't always deposit at once, making it hard to decipher which credit card batch was deposited on which date. There's no easy aspect of creating tribute letters outside of an Excel format spreadsheet. Even then, aspects required tend to be missing.

Allowing group owners to scan assets. There is an occasional false positive

no possibility to print a clear overview of your board or part of your board (bad resolution, too tiny)

Showing a linkage between customer journey, processes and underlined tech infra/products

Allocations. Importing simplicity. More granular permissions

More selections are always welcomed. More selections for up-to-date threats. Quick campaign ideas, kind of like a quick survey, to see if people are aware of certain threats

Easier to get back to projects based on notifications

It would be great to be able to create flow charts to help people move around a big board. Video calling capabilities

Table formatting can be a bit finicky and is limited (e.g. there's not filer for headers). Searching the Miroverse is a bit difficult. Often hard to find exactly what you're looking for. For some reason, when you have a table in a frame, you can't lock all the objects together.

All of the technical improvement requests that we have raised with Bloomreach have been actioned, they are very good at actioning on recommendations from customers.

the user interface would like to see it more interactive (eg. when I want to adjust a list in the dashboard, I have to do it in the search box instead of directly in the list). news collection (eg. I see one source about patents quite often, but it's not that useful for me. tried to turn it off, but did not succeed). trending transcript topics (more integration, eg. two separate topics of "supply constraints" and "supply chain pressure" should be combined?)

Multimedia texting. Easier 3 way calling or conference calling. Ability to connect and integrate with SF

Ticketing. Whilst the ticketing system works, it is fairly basic compared to specific ticketing solutions. Some improvements here would be great. Remote Management - granular options on accounts. You are unable to have some clients or systems which do not require a password for remote access, whilst having this set for other clients/accounts. This makes it a problem if you want to use the remote management component on servers where there is no one available to approve access. Better "built in" remote access software. Whilst the base remote access software works and that the system integrates with larger remote management vendors, some improvements to the remote management component would be beneficial

Getting into the nitty gritty, then--the articles/Help Center has improved vastly in two years and I believe that will continue. however, there are still some shortcomings/missing features and functionality. For example, there's no built-in grammar check (it does spell check, but can't detect usage mistakes). I'd also like the Help Center/articles feature to allow direct access to the HTML/CSS for quick edits of content created using the WYSIWYG editor. You can't control the font at all, other than applying broadly defined styles like H1, H2, H3, or H4. (For example, there's no control over font size, color, or background color/highlighting, although they have recently added some handy support for handsome plug-and-play callouts.). The outbound messaging feature--at least using the "Email" module--has a much more restrictive feature set compared to the Help Center/articles editor. I get the impression it's just not caught up yet. The Help Center/articles feature doesn't play nice with other popular text editors. If I copy and paste from an Intercom article into a Google Doc, for example--which is often necessary--the result is a train wreck of styling failures. Very much of the document styling, white space, table structure where applicable, image sizes, about half the RTF---the whole thing comes off completely wrong. I end up having to spend extra time reformatting the content for the benefit of the intended audience, just to avoid appearing as (more of ) a nincompoop when internal stakeholders review my content.

progress percentage notification. custom automation help/support

Performance analytics is lacking. API Extensibility

I would like more assistance in setting up more pieces of onboarding and offboarding. I would also like to have more assistance with templates and have more help creating them for use.

I would like if there was a way to dismiss requirements (notes or receipt) for certain users or transcations. More prepopulated reports. More widgets on standard dashboard

System slowness at times. Issues with duplicate contacts. Seemingly unresolvable sync errors w/ SFDC

Changing greeting for main phone that customers can hear

version update alert feature should be improve. Syslog server connectivity Alerts should be popup. Email alerting should be improve. Bandwidth of log ingestion should be improve

Some Fake candidates. Some times slow. Otherwise all good

Add references. Update effectively if needed. Add suggestion

attachment of PDF file. Uploading video on text. reply on particular conversation should be like WhatsApp you reply on particular line

2nd Party App Integrations. New Feature Roll Out

Tracking request submission to a specific month can get tricky. Sometimes takes a little extra effort to match an email request to the correct request in the interface. Continue to promote your academy and upcoming learning opportunities

Inbuilt calculator for use with numbers columns - would be useful when forecasting revenue and needing to reallocate amounts to a timeframe. Continue to build out the training resources and learning pathways a la Salesforce.

The ELD’s are great but we’ve recently had issues with them disconnecting. We’re hoping updated models will fix the issue. Customer support isn’t always the easiest to deal with or understand.

As system administrators, it’s hard when tools are not on the front end. Operating without a partner is ideal to move faster and ensure the configuration aligns with the business. Particularly some areas in PM. Redesigning permission layout within manage templates to allow for a better view of what’s currently permissioned would be a huge help

more Layer 3 features. enhanced management and configuration options. more industrial protocols and connectivity options

I'd like to be able to download dashboards as PPT, not only PDF or spreadsheet

More font options when users reply on threads. GIFs are available on the desktop and iPhone app. Adding to-do lists that users can cross out or check off when completed.

Better access to tax advisors for those who have ASO/PEO

Dashboard - current analytics are very high level pass, consider, fail - would like a more detailed breakdown of reasons why consider / fail aggregated in an easy to view format. Speed consistency - sometimes Onfido checks are very fast, sometimes it takes a lot longer. OCR - we had issues with OCR data quality and had to add a step for users to verify information captured via OCR from Driver's Licenses.

The spelling correction feature sometime takes a while to identify and highlight any errors in my grammar. The Main workspace bar on the left should allow for categorizing of the dashboards. For example, it would be nice to be able to assign a unique color folder. An option to pin and move around the folders and highlight them would help. Currently, I have to scroll all the way down on our folder list in order to get to my main workspace.

It's slow on slow machines. It's a bit of a resource hog. It could go even further and add some intelligence and direction to it's wonderful analytics. No reason it couldn't provide recommendations. I am still finding features I love on this application. You could say thats a good thing, but isn't kind of a bad thing -- i have used it so much!

sometimes we got lost between all the detailed functionalities (too granular)

It can cost a lot if not optimized properly. Lack of aggregation functions. Can be hard to learn for users who have no experience in NoSQL.

Well for Miro Board with lot of contents it usually takes lot of time to load. We have whole PI Planning on Miro board with lot of contents and images. Sometimes there is confusion on the select tool whether the hand tool is selected or the edit tool and so there are unwanted changes made.

Sometimes a little too open ended. Integrations can have a learning curve.

Glitches are frequent. Better initial training

Required fields. Site navigation. Email correspondence

Feels like Chorus at times will inconsistently join calls. At times can inconsistency record calls as well

Tables can be too wide so need to side scroll. would love for the search to show similar words (in cases of misspellings). sends too many emails

Add more templates. Make arrow positioning more accurate. Response times for shape add, etc. could be quicker

Restrictions. Permissions. Mobile app

Well I found the user interface quite simple and easy to get along with but what irritating is that you need separate apps for meetings like whenever I am trying to create a meeting from Webex meet, they are transferring me to play store to download another app. I think integrating all the feature in one single app would be much more user friendly!

Transparency to the database. Integration to other systems. Effective dating. Sync to organizational data. Reporting

More automation, other software in this space is able to completely rewrite content and even provide multiple iterations at once. Ability to tailor results and desired output based on target audience, i.e. desired grade level might vary based on audience. Would be nice if VT can start writing content based on bullet points, again more automation

notification need to be there before clicking on upgrade button. Notification need to be there before reboot collector. Delaying to present the current uptime when rebooted a collector

Learning management system. Onboarding 2.0. Recruiting

Nutanix AHV support. Chrome plugin. Interface is not as easy as other products.

Custom queries can be a little complicated to work with. Pricing can get a little steep

Not frequently updated with new features. Outdated pricing plan focused on enterprise customers. Enterprise support is not up to the expected level

More Access to Customize the UI

Management, I would say a single pane of management that works would be good. Similar to the FTD, the FMC, being able to manage objects and security group objects in one pane. That would be good for the firewall versus having to manually create objects and monitor them across several different firewalls across several different contexts.

I find the creation of custom reports help page hard to follow - in the sense that actual finished report does not meet the expectation. The old format of receive payment screen which Sage Intacct intends to phase out is more useful to my end, I use the new one but I like the format of the old view better. In the creation of the Statement of Account I hope there are more options - like Show only those bills with open balance; Show only credit memos available or a combination of both. Right now there are only 4 available - see below. Show all transactions. Show all but reversed payments. Show affiliates and others with no balance if activity occurred. Show affiliates and others flagged as inactive if activity occurred

There are a couple of streaming platforms I'm not able to screen record

Expensive for small organisations. Improving in the sync error area with explanation. Many windows open when we click the new tab. This area can be improved.

Updates to content on lower tiers. Better reporting features. More automation in phisher

Wrike Discover could use some updating and the sign-on process is cumbersome. Significantly more powerful duplication functionality to allow ease of replicating work structures and various work items, custom item types, blueprints and forms etc *across spaces*. Dashboard visibility for the Collaborator License!. Ability to grant/revoke permissions for collaborators to edit custom field data

Integration with client's digital tracking, such as GTM. More filter criteria for customizing event feed pages. Reporting on activist codes beyond 14 days. Report manager capabilities and customization. Analytics dashboards.

Drag and drop. Comparability with visio

The email design interface is not the easiest to use. I'd love to be able to see a preview in the same window where I am editing; maybe something you can click and it expands, but you don't have to leave the editor.

I think it is pretty easy to use, can't think of any

I don't know of any improvements as PowerDMS by NEOGOV does so much more than I have attempted to use it for thus far.

Integration from Veeam Data Platform with Office 365

Support. Quality of data. Ease of enablement

Agent training. Timeliness in responding. Follow up on reported problems and corrections

more options of checking logs

Information resources can be confusing at times. Mobile phone backup.

looking at the RPA market competitor UIPath , the IBM licensing is twice in Cost as compared to UiPath but offers better value. process stability along with the flexibility in 3rd party integration apps. unclear guidelines in the documentations and slow initialization or implementation

In my opinion, permissions model is unpleasant. In my opinion, automation with anything that isn't an Atlassian product extraordinarily difficult. In my experience, it doesn't support current standards very well (Markdown, importing HTML). In my opinion, search is almost useless

Copy to tape interfers with normal backups. Please create a process which tags the most current back to be copied to tape that will allow tape and disk backup to coinside.

Different thing means i can sea Interview scheduleing and database maintaing. As a single software doing multiple purpose is really plus for the organization to save the cost and time. In this above points i mostly liked.

UI for Mobile. Workspace organization for guests. Pricing. Duplicate group without having to manually remove the (copy) text after duplicating

Some users find the initial setup and configuration process complex. Simplifying the user interface and providing more intuitive onboarding processes could enhance the user experience, especially for new users or smaller businesses with limited resources for extensive training.

Sync with Hubspot. Additional features.

Faster in utilizing suggestions from admins. Updating certifications

Difficult to configure. fewer and fewer experienced professionals. Price

More like the timing of the retrieval and response time that we get. I think that we would need to ensure to make it better.

Overall UX is good, however can be further improved. The new GenAI tool is a great addition - however limited to only specific element and to a specific and pre-defined tasks. I would further appreciate if it would be able to further expanded and support more commands or even support manual/custom instructions to the AI. Also Each element current holds its own limited command - thus you cannot execute AI commands on a group of different elements, which is very limited. I'm a great advocate of AI and believe that this is the future, so it's amazing to see Miro adapts to the latest advances. However, there's so much that should and could be done, and now when AI tools gives you the freedom to do possibly anything, It's bad to see that it's actually limiting the user. I have deep and rich experience with AI tools and their implementations in various tools, thus I feel strongly the lack and limitation of AI usage within Miro. I have to many ideas and capabilities that would skyrocket Miro, thus make me feel so much limited with the current implementation of AI. I trust the Miro team to further expand it, I'd be happy to get on another call with the team and share my experience and vision.

I think the visualization offerings, although they're starting to get better for sure, could definitely continue to use some upgrading. They've had the same set of visualizations for a lot of years, and while they're improving the ability to alter them or to change the settings on them, they definitely could use more of them. We saw a demo where they announced some new visualizations that are going to be possible and are definitely a good step in the right direction to do that. I think in terms of the tool, especially when you're talking about workspace, is fairly stable as a tool. I think the support side is probably where a there could be a little bit more of an improvement. Adobe hasn't always been great on the support side, especially if you're not a premier member or have a special connection, some type of connection with them in that respect. If you're just an average company using the tool and you run into trouble and you need some help, you can file a ticket and get support, but it's not always been the greatest support. But the tool itself, I don't know that I have a ton of complaints at this point, especially with workspace. It's been fairly stable for a few years now. So just the support part I think is probably the bigger one and the visualization.

Sales outreach tools could be improved.

Sometimes, it is hard to reach over the phone compared to other vendors if a rapid response is needed. Haven’t seen them in direct conversation with a client or answering lead feedback as of yet. This situation just hasn’t come about yet to no fault of their own. Lower coverage in some smaller markets. Display activity, in our experience hasn’t been as strong compared to other vendors, with the main goal being CTR.

Sales Alerts - could provide more information, allow for more orgs to be identified, creating them based on keywords is beyond challenging as I cannot use keyword groups and instead must add each keyword manually. Geographic areas - would love to be able to provide one zip code for a segment and ask for a radius of 20,50, etc miles around it, or even just ask for the geographic area relative to a specific city (DC Metro area, as an example). RevCity/User Community - it's good and a nice start but the system doesn't provide reminders regularly to go check it out. Most of the posters tend to be 6sensers, and several questions can go unanswered.

The Excel reader node doesn't always reset. Sometimes the node has to be rebuilt or reconfigured to truely reset the node. This can trip you up if you're not aware of it. Basic filtering in table view. Sure you just add a filter node, but it would be cool if the data tables worked more like tables in Excel where you can filter as well as sort.

Web editor. Visualization of the flags. Information about testing.

Provide trending hashtags; make recommendations for optimal use. Remember most used handles in the user interface. Have a creative space, a white board to pin ideas or develop campaigns. Colour coding or 'client' or content tagging.

Having mandatory fields for projects to progress in their stages. Generating customized natural language reports of project updates. Automatically calculated elapsed time based on a set initial date

I think ClickUp performance needs to be improved when loading data, when opening a detailed list, also when opening a dashboard with many widgets also takes quite a long time. expand the automation options that ClickUp provides. expand widgets on the ClickUp dashboard

Listening to, and following feedback. Avoid changing account managers so often

Back end functions are complex and unforgiving; takes us 1 month to train a new administrator properly due to the complexity of the system. The navigation and user experience are not modern or easy to use out of the box. It requires a significant investment with partner firms to configure the UX.

to work with more different types of files. more detailed onfo about tested emails. more flexible credits buying system

I can't think of anything

It's hard to say off the top of my head. Like I come across issues almost on a daily basis. But they're small things. There are things that would make my life easier as a developer, right? If certain configurations maybe were a little more intuitive or automated. But I also think that it's improving a tremendous amount and we just went live with am as a cloud service customer on like, just this past week and it was one of the smoothest goli I've ever had. So I think it's, it's come a very long way.

Perhaps add some gamifications. Perhaps add little celebration animations when projects are completed

Would like to see additional software integration options.

Calendar Interaction (so users can book an appointment with the designer). Be able to manipulate the automatic message people get after submitting a form. Everything else works for me

It could be more user-friendly. Connection to cloud lags at times. Interferences with other software

Executive reports could provide more customization with user details. Faster response time to console after user completes training

Simplified Budgeting. Simplified report writing. More resourceful forums for quick troubleshooting

Too many areas that may not be needed. the average date range that shows up at the bottom is sometimes confusing. more colors for color coding

User-friendly navigation. Creating reports could be more robust

time tracking

It would be great if there was some kind of notification feature to enable when you receive a milestone, hit a goal etc

configuring multi factor authentication for third party products was a little bit difficult. teams integration. redirection of camera and microphone from applications

Possibly more engineers/techs due to scheduling being very tight timeframes. There were features I wasn't aware of till a year after (example some API capabilities).

It is expensive, but is worth it. Their Sales Team runs from Excellent down to Inattentive (The inattentive one seems to have moved on). Quoting for help seems high.

I believe that the "live" option in monitoring does not truly update the status in real-time, thus I must manually update to feel comfortable. The call analysis tool might be improved, third-party resources are restricted, and the pricing is slightly more than competitors in comparable categories.

Compliance documentation for onboarding and off-boarding employees. HR Support Employee Relations. Workflow Management, it's very difficult to correct or pull back something once processed. Org Chart Reporting

Integration. Make it less manual. Premade template for layouts

In future IBM cloud could provide free or paid courses for learning cloud computing

The results are not being counted correctly to train the users who failed

Load speed. Multi language support. Transactional email sending

Collaboration across companies

Ceipal has more resumes. Keywords that are correct matches the resumes. Sourcing the profile is the easy way.

Feature to be be greatly available for non EC customers too

Some small functionality flaws. Wish it were easier to mass edit

When I click into a task, it is not always easy to find my way back to the project level. When I clone a project for the next one, it is hard to control which aspects get cloned and which I want to populate with new information. I don't really know how to get an overall view of my to dos. Sometimes I am given access to a project, but not sub-tasks or attachments, which is annoying.

Direct Customer support would be the only thing I could think of but support through the admin for my account has always been very timely and efficient

Chat times out too quickly. I'm still typing my Question and I have the orange banner up telling 10 sec left. Better turnaround time on questions. If an item is escalated, forget it. It takes days to weeks to get an answer. (If Chat people know, then all is good). Integrate with our 401K provider, Fidelity, so that process is automated.

Greater ability to apply constraints to a board/project. More organization of files - tagging, foldering

Functionality -- not super streamlined or clean. Integrations with other softwares like Asana, Slack, etc.

Search features are not always easy to use. Documentation can get messy if not organized well. Slow to load at times

Invoicing procedures. Pricing clarity. Ownership

Database Log Shipping. Server Level Triggers. Custom password policies

Simple & easy to use. Very Intuitive. Easy to administrate

Having multiple log ons between the different sage environments is hard to navigate (University vs Intacct)

Complex Pricing Model:. Limited Integration with Non-IBM Services. Data Transfer Speeds

Logs. Graphical view of servers

System isn't super user friendly. Can't make mass updates, have to do them one by one.

Genesys Cloud CX can probably improve the support of other languages than English. We still need to wait for a little time. Some features are available in French. They can be improved in analytics. It's still sometimes quite difficult to get the Pro Analytics.

Enhanced mobile app functionality. Improved calendar view. Advanced reporting - in-depth insights into project performance, team productivity, and resource allocation. guided tutorials for advanced features. multi-step automations with conditional logic

Maybe a better querying tool.

Some automations and functions within subitems

Inbox and updates changes aren't as good as the old version. Allowing emails from same domain email addresses not to be added if not paid user. In our business most people do not require a licence as day to day they use our legal case management system but it would be useful if their emails could be added if replying to a board email. Reporting on the time recording element

Faster forwarding

Touch interface might be an issue. Requires USB-C connection for touch. No touch capability with MacOS

I'm not able to see some of the documents that I'm a reviewer for (not sure why, but I think I'm a collaborator) and have unknowingly help up multiple approvals. I'm not able to add some people as a reviewer for my documents. I'm not able to create any new folders or projects in my personal space. I'm not able to see all of the requests submitted by other people (would be really helpful to find links where people ordered stuff before or made revisions to a document)

Reports could use a little upgrade. Delegated activities function.

Move some functions from SAP CRM to Sales Cloud (C4C). Replication between C4C and CRM is sometimes an issue and some functionality sit in CRM while potential users of that feature use sales cloud

We are a time sheet based company and I wish my time sheets would automatically attach to invoices. My clients want one attachment per email when invoiced. If I include attachments to my invoice the email has multiple attachments and I can't send those emails to my clients. So, I have to manually create the invoice/attachment for those clients. So, I wish that the invoice creation would automatically merge the invoice and all attachments into one attachment. For time sheets, we wish that there could be more than one time sheet approver assigned to an employee. Our time sheet approvers go on vacation and wish that they could have their alternate approve the time sheet, without us having to re-assign a new approver - and with out us having to delete the original time sheet filled out by the employee. For time sheets we wish that managers would get more than one email that the time sheet needed approval. For time sheets, we wish that employees could not turn off the notifications that the time sheets are due. For our specific purposes, our tracking of where sales takes place is not the project..but it is where the employee that works for that project is working. So far the location tracking is not accurately tracking where my sales are taking place. So, either we are not set up correctly, or Sage Intacct is not able to track this correctly. So, my project is [..]..[..] is located in Kansas. One person assigned to [..] is working in Missouri and one person working [..] is working in Texas. Sage Intacct is recording all of the sales for [..] in Kansas and I need them to be in Missouri and Texas because that is where the work is taking place.

IBM Power servers cost too much compared to RHEL on X86 on VMware. IBM Power server maintenance costs too much compared to RHEL on X86 on VMware.

affecting the cms when the code is slightly more complicated on the back end. the login/verification process every time is a little annoying. would like to track the data visually all together in a snapshot of all experiments done on one page over time

Easier integration between boards. Easier email automation. Less crashing

More training videos on specific functionalities

Lower cost of entry so we can onboard some of our smaller offices to this solution. Improved knowledge base article searching as it can be difficult to locate the correct information. Less nagging from sales team when renewals are approaching

Reports generation would be great to have a more generic reports field generator

kubernets. virtual machines. databases

Dashboard Builder: It needs more out-of-the-box panels for beginners to learn. Autofill: The query autofill isn't that great. It needs better suggestions for beginners especially. Speed: The speed of the search isn't that great. It can be improved. For some queries, it takes too long. Error handler: The error messages in the case of wrong syntax can be more descriptive. The messages are sometimes vague and are not helpful.

Expensive for the number of previews it includes UI can be confusing Limited templates

Commiunity information should be available under the new look/experience of Cvent. The administration courses should be broken down to simplify learning. QR codes should be implemented in the new surveys.

Provisioning. Ease of use for admins. More information about releases

The constant nudge to upgrade to the next tier. In my opinion, web interface is dated and dry. I believe billing management is problematic

Help identify suspicious emails to staff. Make review of quarantined emails easier. Have their tab more prominent

Segment filtering by priority or operation. Segment exports could have more data within them. Sometimes the model isn't as accurate as we'd like

bigger profile. make more minimal instructions. add extra details about the AI

I'd like to see a more diverse range of modules, the ones they do have are good but limited to just 1 or maybe 2 on certain topics. It would be nice to have the ability to edit an active training campaign to update the modules without having to clone and create a new one, then add in the modules. Their mod store search function could be improved with quick categories/topics.

A-Coin lucky draw contest could be done differently. Inviting food companies to, where offers could be redeemed. Showing the expiry of advantage club points so that the customers have a clear idea of the same.

has no room for improvement. There is no missing functionality,. Happy to use the Guru

The upgradability of the routers is great, but very expensive. The need for increased memory/flash for current features

simpler and more intuitive Interface. more extensive integration with third-party tools. Real-time collaboration for analysis and report generation

So we have had a tough time integrating into the environment and currently, we're not getting value for the product too as well. So that will be something we'll be looking to talk to the account officer about and see how to better utilize the product.

More automations. More optimized Outlook to Monday

Add a bit more user flexibility. let users change background colors to match organizations color scheme

I have not encountered any issues.

Admin dashboard is clunky. No bulk change to all the numbers you use, you have to do it one at a time. Dashboard capabilities are not as good as Talkdesk. Reporting is not as good as Talkdesk

The availability of shapes (arrows) could be increased in the shapes menu. The fill colour in the menu option disappears when its "white" with a white background - make it more obvious. More graphical adjustments to frames e.g. shadow options

a large volume of email alerts

When a task has been marked as "on hold" or "cancelled" it continues to remind you, which I find quite annoying. While making date adjustments in a blueprint, changes happen somehow that I can't understand so I end up going back and forth multiple times to adjust unexpected changes that just happened without a visible explanation. Some tasks are allowed in without a due dates and of course they won't show up in the timeline

User experience has an old look/feel. Modules are complex and it is confusing about how everything fits together

Needs improvement in the user interface. Improve the documentation for users' understanding. Adding more pre-built automated workflows

Everything is smooth and easy to use.

No all the parameters can be managed

After installing the Chrome Plugin, LinkedIn is a bit slower than before. Pricing is okay, but import from Sales Navigator should be included in the Basic Package

Sometimes large PDF files (annual reports, flyer suites, etc) don't upload properly. Requires a few refreshes to fix that.

Would like more action buttons easily visible from each page

Refresh the UI. Rankings

If we work on the same thing at the same time, it doesn't save correctly

As soon as the payment status turns to “Paid” the entry gets blocked, not allowing us to make any changes. However, in practical scenarios, there will be instances where we need to make some corrections. It would be of great help if we could get this feature enabled. Audit Log – Need to improve the audit log to provide more accurate and complete information about any changes. Since we are in an era of Social Marketing – more the visual impact, more the over all impact. So need to incorporate Dashboard Feature to get a glimpse of the health of the process/company by an eagle eye view.

It does appear to be a little glitchy when you go from template mode to CLI mode and try to do testing on certain areas. The configuration tends to get hung in that old session when you drop it from being controlled by the controller to making changes in CLI. I've had a lot of instances where you try to put it back into controller mode for review management and it holds on to your items you've had in CLI mode , it gets a little confused at which config it needs to use. You end up having to reset the whole number environment.

Please be more flexible in adding column template, so that it doesn't have to be follows previous group task in one project

Hootsuite has room to improve when it comes to consistency - sometimes videos are difficult to upload, sometimes things get double posted by accident, or occasionally something will be scheduled but an unforeseen error will cause it not to post.

There are certain areas of Hubspot that take getting used to. Building my first workflow was difficult and took a few interactions with the support team to solve. Thankfully Hubspot support is pretty quick to respond and usually helpful. The reports are great but can take some custom work to get set up that took some time to figure out. Sometimes there is too much information available, I wish I could customize some of the pipeline views to make it simpler/cleaner.

notification of system failures. user assess of files

Provide more training modules at lower statuses. Website tabs can be more simplified to locate desired information. Need to improve the instructions on how to run reports

I have yet to find anything. this product already works great. it does exactly what it is intended to do and does it well. I would like to see an option for more of the fields to populate across different feature segments when programming

Improve integration capabilities with Test Automation Suites. Access provisioning to ensure security of passwords

Extending project and item functionality to subitems. Increasing customization of calendar view - e.g., toggle weekends. Improving time tracking - current utilization system is not suitable for fully fledged daily time tracking

Some mass edit features could be added, such as changing suppliers in sourcing for all affected parts when a semiconductor company acquires another company but keeps the same part numbers..currently parts need to be changed individually.

Support. Installation. Training and Materials. Need More logs (log files) at every level for enhanced security

Support other virtualization software like Proxmox and Xen, newer versions of them. It needs to test more the new features before releasing them.

marking duplicate items. faster loading of data on single board

If using Aurora Serverles v2 one thing missing is the possibility to reduce it to 0 ACU

Case Management ( for reported incidents/probems). Time is takes to resolve tier2 type problems. Lack of Subject matter experts

Reports and Dashboards need visual improvements. New Reports and Dashboards cannot use OData. Workflow needs to be added to all entities

Segment creations can be a bit confusing to manage and edit once they are created. Some of the email comparison data is confusing to understand

Archiving boards means that they archive for everyone, which can be a little frustrating if you have far too many boards and want to clear out your folders, but you don't want them to be removed for anyone else. The inbox really doesn't work well. There is no way to select all and perform an operation with multiple inbox items - and if you have hundreds of boards, then it can mean thousands of updates over the years! I don't use the inbox at all for this reason. The My Week function behaves similarly to the Inbox, so if it's flooded, it's impossible to use.

Restoration: Veeam Backup for 365 can be a pain when restoring. It may take a while to open folders or files. Explorer: Veeam Explorer has been very slow to run when searching for specific files. Support: Support with Veeam could be better.

system respond speed is slow when perform financial adjustment. it take time to run when switching from individual task to team task. searching tool is slow to respond

Archival of old groups and items

More Robust Financial Reporting. Easier Data Uploads. More Flexibility in Workflows

Not being able to add on to a question following publishing

For a social media calendar, it would be nice to see the images added.

Text editor or wysiwyg need some improvements. Some formatting issues with copy and paste and limitation (indentations of paragraphs etc.). While you can create cards in multiple boards, it is confusing sometimes (best to reference cards to other boards than have them in many boards. Moving cards or sharing them with other Collections (while you can point to another collection, sometimes no permission for the team with that collection).

Response time and availability from the tax team. Implementation

I would like to see Meraki implement a more robust logging feature for the firewall side of this. That's one thing that's lacking between an MX and a traditional ASA. ASA gives you a more in-depth and granular view of logging, whereas compared to the MX it only gives you very minor details and glimpses at things.

A few too many clicks to jump between boards and dashboards. Adding 'favourites' or 'quick links' could help

It doesn't have a great communication feature like Slack.

So on the workforce management side, the biggest glaring error, well not error, but something they could definitely improve on is they do schedule preferences by week. In Europe, they don't work by week, they work by month. So one area they could definitely improve on is to be able to do schedule prefacing on a monthly basis.

I think a lot of the things are gonna be addressed now, like with the launch. I think it's like a firefly that's coming up that seems very beneficial, especially for the design team where it's like we're trying to create all these different assets and bring it into one area for people to use in multiple different areas. I think, and pretty much that I don't really have anything too negative to say about it because it's a very like uniform and unique experience overall and it's very easy for us to use.

Creation of goals by folder. dashboard color and structure customization. Possibility to integrate ClickUp view into microsoft teams

Limited in gifting options outside of branded swag. Does not offer experiences/events like other direct mail platforms (Sendoso, Alyce, etc). The UI is just OK - not the slickest thing I've seen

Once a board has been set up, extremely difficult to add core features that were not selected at the start. Gets slow when a lot of information is added in one document hosted on monday.com. The platform can be very overwhelming for new users.

I've used Marketo even before it was Adobe. And when Adobe bought Marketo, there were high expectations that it would be integrated very well with the rest of the Adobe platforms. For example, take Adobe Analytics, but Marketo doesn't talk to them natively. You have to be really creative to make that work. I think that's one of the pain points is that they have a good partner ecosystem, but still, the basic stuff is missing. Custom activities and custom events are something that makes Marketo so unique. And the use cases, and the problems it solves, are amazing. But it's annoying when tokens are such a good feature and you can't use tokens for custom fields in the custom activities and events. RCE, a fantastic idea, but the UX is from the 1980s. It makes it so hard for to present a dashboard to my senior leadership. There is a wealth of information which is just not usable. I know that there's Marketo Measure, but it's an expensive add-on vs native functionality.

Really the things that need to improve are things that needs to be changed by our company. They need more guru cards on certain topics. keywords added so things can be pulled up. better training on what to search

Easier way to create your own trainings.

Limited use of emojis, that is bad when working with millennials. Search engine can the improved. The results are not showed in a simple way.

Mobile Outlook emails do not automatically BCC tracking address. Mobile App should allow for individual user customozation. Is there a News notification for logged accounts?. At least in our setup, I'm unable to view my entire inbox/outbox. I'd love to solely live in HubSpot land.

When cash apps is performed for multiple invoices at once, we cant reverse cash apps performed for one invoice. It will reverse all the invoices. Bulk payment for AP Bills is required. While adding reference for Cash Application lengthy reference is unable to add.

Could have a glossary explanation of terms. layout seems amazing to me. could have more signposting options for customer.

project roll up health into program views. analytics - limitation on rows for dashboard reports. resource planning is not very intuitive

User interface. Easy to operate. Loading speed

There is still some limited awareness in the market about the benefits of tokenization

Limited Availability of Compatibility Versions. Complexity in Cross-Region Replication. Storage Scaling Limitations

There is no hard in Ceipal. it's an user friendly for recruiter.

reporting (visualization). integration with Microsoft (power automate connectors)

when creating a change - (loading forecast/financial information) previous information gets overwritten unless you copy the previous plan

Secondary index management. Migration tooling. Point in time recovery performance

Adding a option to convert so spanish. Could be cheaper for enterprise options. Ability to edit the font on the items

I found that model deployment is a bit difficult for non-IT background like myself. EDA may be improved. Should show estimated time to complete for each run

RPA tends to involve some technical expertise to use and set up, making it hard to onboard and standarize at times. identifying inside the tool the specific conditions in which automated actions are needed can be hard for less experienced workers. Many of it broad features usually have a former equivalent inside business' processes, which at times is hard to transfer to IBM RPA. This may duplicate procedures which is not the best case scenario as regards efficiency.

Account management - too many "rogue" accounts are created. Discovery - Network catalogues are a nice feature but should be better controllable in regard to reach - as we are not allowed to sell everything to everyone.

Better built-in notifications.

Would like to see something more advanced targeting technical users. Videos sometimes play but do not getting credit for watching video. Would like to see more in depth about social engineering since that is where the most problems take place.

integration with Email Security Gateways

Setup of account to communicate with Cloud Providers. Tagging documentation

Email bugs. Reporting bugs. Alphabetical organizing in fields

Reporting. Interface is kind of clunky. More ability for administrators to independently make changes without relying on support

Can be a bit slow at first. Nothing else

My organization and I are new to Webex Events. At this time, there is nothing to dislike. and nothing that is difficult to use

the gui is not very intuitive. restarting the service could be faster. choosing the correct storage and instance type could be challenging

Not great reports. Context around some built in alerting. Slow interface

I absolutely love the chat feature but sometimes I get such advice that things are made worse, I would love more knowledgeable reps. I get a lot of errors on payroll day about not being able to save changes and it really slows me down and sometimes I miss things because I thought they saved. I wish I was better at reporting but at summit the reporting sessions don't really get focused on payroll

Limited to 8 top line dimensions. Although you can bring in as many attributes of data as you want, but I would really like Cube to increase top line dimensions to 10. The ability for cross level interaction within multiples cube would be a major plus once implemented.

Contact numbers in Middle East. Direct contact numbers in Americas. Filtering

Mac platform

A view of current features missing from current code implementation. Alerts of critical errors. Metrics on server performance issues that can be improved

If claim is not approved, submission of bills is difficult. Sometimes it shows error message during uploading of receipts. User interface appears older or dull.

Response time for investigating issues can be way better. Need more space and codes. Organizations charts need to be easier

the cursor response time could be improved. dual screen remote session quality could be improved

Review Email Templates. UGC Display Templates. More granular filters (like date submitted) for Reviews, Q/A, and UGC

Ease of Use. Pricing

Anamolly detection will be more useful if it can leverage business dimensions. ASG recommendation are generally too aggressive, will be good to give option to choose the performance metric teams are willing to change and display the chosen metric. Chart visualisation can be improved, for example, using a consistent colour for a Product or Service Name, and have value labels to differentiate value for different section of the chart

The interface is a bit dated

I would like to be able to pull contacts by County instead of just zip code. I would like a simpler process to delete obselete Activist Codes. It would be nice if EveryAction provided a Bulk Upload Contact Sheet template to minimize the CRM rejecting bulk uploads.

My main struggle is when i type in search when i want to know how to do certain things, I don't know if it's maybe the language barrier my side. I struggle with the bank rule but that could be me. I really would like to see some explanations done practically, some tutorials have videos. Maybe its me I am old school, but would love to have proper training face to face practicality

The formatting is intentionally limited, but it serves to keep creation simple and make using it easy.

Once you get used to the platform it's easy to use but a lot of my new teammates take some time to figure out how to build their own boards/where to find boards.

we want to use it as a CRM tool, this is not possible. there could be more options to coztomize. too much ntifications

Sorting courses within a course bundle. Increase the speed of the certificate report.

Adding more on the free version. Free pro accounts for charities. Bigger box for alt text as text gets lost.

Better integration with other repository systems like Confluence

Some documentation is out of date

It would be helpful for people who need it if there were more extensive and user-friendly instructions, especially for newbies.

User Interface

Pasting tables can be improved, it should be able to hold more formatting from an Excel table and requires to much formatting. Easier overview of shortcuts. Better search function when searching for appropriate templates.

I feel like I could have answered that just last week, as good as you make it. So with that said, I'm kind of going to go back to getting with the NT team and fully understanding the way it works to know the best ways to go about it. So on that same flip side, I would say it was the transcription and then we've also had some call recording issues and some, because we've actually got a ticket open now for some duplicated calls and where it flipped the agent and the customer in the recording. So there's little bumps. So if I had to say any of those would probably be problematic, but just specifically for us, I can't speak to everybody, but the Verint team is very supportive and they're doing what they can to keep us in the loop and what they're doing to fix it. So we're doing, I think it's good considering

Simplified version for the various users. Easier to track fax report. More extensive QA center.

its a great tool for making data-driven decisions easly. Seamless integrations with other IBM solutions and wide range of third-party apps which enables end-to-end automation across heterogeneous systems. IBM RPA is very scalable tool that allows us to scale our automation efforts according to our organisation needs.

Offer automated cheat sheet. Pricing could be more clear

sometimes people cannot hear/be heard. It would be great to have more detailed info (with graphics) about the team and individual performance. team performance reports daily/weekly/monthly mail functions would be great

Local language support (Turkish, Hindi, Malay characters). Semantic analysis. Local Currency Support

Pre-populating Management/User Templates

Real time updates are slightly delayed if your resource synchronization is high

Certain features are locked behind admin and shouldn't be. Guest feature. Team leader should automatically be made co-owner of public boards in their department.

Integration scenarios. Automated processes like core data replication. Support Services from SAP Concur

I experience some lag sometimes. It takes a bit of time to load each device

Everyone hates the "rejected" status. There has to be a better word without such a negative connotation. Too many options for customization at some times. It's difficult to figure out what features do and if you actually need them. Multiple notifications can be overwhelming.

sections in the changes that I mark, I'd like to see those sections pre-marked based on tracking my prior markings in that section - for a quicker submission

Recurring tasks. Roadmap

Documentation need more improvement for self developer. Integration between suites can be improved. It needs A lot of effort to learn, very difficult for beginners. Pricing of licenses are too high

Make the formula examples a little more thorough

I would like to see an expanded ability to download the diagrams

There is no unlimited texting plan. System down issues (when they happen) are not resolved as quickly as I would prefer. Tighter integration, or better training on, using it across applications.

I would say Guru can be improved by adding a few filters that allow one to search specific topics.

ManageEngine Application Manager could benefit from improved support for monitoring and managing chatbot applications and infrastructure.

Customer support. Interface isn't user friendly. Sometimes slow

Cisco Webex App still need to work on integrations, Slack is the leader in terms of integrating with other applications. a bit costlier when compared to MS. MS E5 has it for free. Availability in some countries like Russia still not there

Role based permissions. Workflow integration, specifically the previewing functionality

Can be quite complex for small orgs. Lots of options, but can be expensive to implement

Collaboration features could use some improvement

I have to refresh the page a lot because there is an "update"

Some functions are more hidden. For certain modifications, you need to take more steps. MERGADO includes additional applications that you activate separately, although it would be great if I could enable their functions directly while editing the XML feed

Even more connectivity between modules for more seamless experience. Better reporting on permissions structures and user access. In my opinion, some modules feel a bit dated compared to other offerings

More automations. App version

I wish you could select multiple cells at one time. I wish sub-item columns could change per group instead of all needing to be the same

time tracking. calendar to do list (with more than 20 boards connected). dashboard widgets (specifically one thats just text)

Emails landing in spam

Search functionality. speed

There are definitely some features and functionality we'd like to see. We have groups in workspaces, but they don't seem to be tied into very many portions of Genesys Cloud CX. You can only use groups and workspaces in specific places. It'd be nice if we could integrate those more where we already have these groups rather than building those same groups of people in another form to use in this section. One thing I hear constantly from my quality monitors is: can we add a mass delete button for interactions that have been delivered? I had a person recently, they had a policy running, forgot about it. A couple months later they went in and they had 300 interactions, so they had to delete them all one by one by one. Little things like that that hopefully are in the roadwork.

Access to reports

EC time sheets and Time tracking doesn't meet minimum legal standards. Meeting local legislative standards

Easier communication process among team members. Update notifications linked to e-mails. Collaboration boards

For this moment click up has everything we need

Monitoring. GUI design and functionality. Solaris backup. Longer SLA retention rather than just 999 days.

The UI is a bit out dated but nothing to worry about.

Comparing it to Vyond, it is more time consuming to make videos. The timeline could be easier to understand. They recently started upcharging to use some scenes. This has made updating some of my videos challenging as the scenes that were included as part of my plan are now an upgrade to use. They don't have a voice over option. I have actually taken some of the videos out of the platform over to Vyond to add voiceover. Some items they have introduced, like turning a powerpoint into a video really don't work.

official support for GCC HIGH - it's only beta now, although it does work

Everyone on the team needs a full license to really function. We thought some people could get away with guest licenses, but that was not feasible. The options the "guests" had were different, and it frustrated them which slowed down user acceptance. It's too easy to create a task and not save it when you think you did. The recurring tasks settings are clunky, or I'm just not getting it yet!

Allow more unregistered users to view boards.

Cost saving for personal use. Not logging me out haha

Training documents. Full picture processed prior to releases. Access to experts

Add more in-built model templates. Visualization option would be plus. Enable more reports to add more metrix on usage

I would love to have more predictive insights. I would love to get alerts when certain goals are met or close

The service team is wonderful and helpful but seem very swamped. It is difficult to get a hold of the assigned account manager but I can always reach another team member. The development team needs to remember that the least amount of clicking around in a system to get what you need is always best. There is a lot of room for improvement in this area for the Recruiting module.

Administration and permissions model can be confusing. Lots of tabs when switching between applications. Rapid start via accelerators (*this is now possible)

Teradata is already a gem of software. However teradata could incorporate antivirus to ensure any malfunction could be avoided. Teradata modules could be enhanced

More features at cheaper prices

New SI a bit buggy. Technographics not quite accurate. Predictive analytcis would be better if it was slightly editable. Contact recommendation editing

permissions and sharing can be confusing. formula columns are limited

Managed backups could be better. Triggered scheduling, and being able to back up different areas of data at different times would be great. The clearscape interface should be provided as an option in the cloud on an application node in the same instance as the database. Add better ability to use timestamps - functions to add dates and times to get a timestamp, convert timestamp(6) to timestamp(0) easily, etc.

Price. Onprem application onboarding.

Files sometimes take a long time to download. Finding a way to assign multiple people to a project/task and have each individual get it crossed off their list without completing for all (instead have to create all individual tasks). Sometimes the sorting/ordering functionality doesn’t work as hoped

Saving customized list outputs. Evaluation of who is assigned which license

More options for customization for phone trees. Option to restart the loop through available agents if the call wasn’t answered by any available agents the first time it was served to them. Improve clarity/info available on whether a message was actually sent to the end user or not

Scale Computing delivers an excellent product. I have no points for improvement to mention

allow more users under a single entity. allow users to add timelines to projects instead of just start and end date. more advanced project management tools

Customer service; I feel like it sometimes takes weeks for a response from our dedicated CSM

I think the reporting. The data that's collected could be easier for the business to be able to manipulate. I think that the new products that are coming out that they could be more focused on the customer needs versus what Avaya says they should be. Best way I could put it.

Performance Reviews - we originally did performance reviews in paycom, but switched that to another platform. It doesn't have an autosave function that I'm aware of and the layout is not visually pleasing if you're sitting and writing long text. it does most other things well. It does most other things well

more details in work order request form. being able to change the content on the mobile app. filters disappear for some reason

Chat assistant be broader with help issues. I don’t have any issues at this time

Invoice system is hard to bill because address do not line up with envelope labels. Wish you could delete entries made in error instead of reversing.

Benefits on the backend can be challenging, but it has improved some. Custom reports can be a challenge if there are more criteria/filters.

The mobile app has the one issue that causes me to lose audio. Is there a fix without turning off the setting which allows me to transfer calls?. When using the mobile app and needing to transfer a call, I've noticed the employee list looks a little weird. It doesn't appear to be in order of name or extension. But maybe that's a setting I have marked incorrectly.

User Interface. Registration and Login. Integration with other Softwares

Too many videos/training videos are released at once. Inside Man has been going on tooooooooo long

Some reporting functions are not available. Filters and additional details on approvals. Creating a payroll / expense report.

Customization. Advance reporting and updates on opportunity. Pricing. Advance sales features

selfmonitoring - need to add detection of monitoring has stopped. guides, manuals, knowledge base - very misleading, not detailed, does not cover many situations. SL Support on daily issues - from experience, often not much helpful, the support case you raise for them is often not followed, replies are seldom, they try only to close the case ASAP without any solution, without asking you if this solution is ok for you

The interface is incredibly clunky. I felt that it would struggle often when I would try to complete a campaign. The service is a bit overwhelming to use at the start. If you don't understand many of the features, there are plenty of 3rd party groups to receive information from.

End-to-end workflow of engineering projects can be setup as workflow of templates. Offline edit feature could be handy. Dark theme can be added

More insight into errors that may be causing an issue when configuring an integration, e.g. Veracode's Jira integration. Static Analysis can sometime get 'stuck' when using the Jenkins integration. Days, sometimes weeks can go by before we notice. Have to delete the 'stuck' scan and re-upload. Manual Pen Test account management/reminders. I would expect the vendor to reach out and schedule the pen test annually, maybe send a notification/reminder when the date starts getting close, things like that. From my experience it was on me to initiate our MPT.

Pricing and transparency. Shading more light into the pricing structure would be really appreciated especially by potential clients. The licensing is very costly.

Visuals. Mobile app. Customisation

Financial Management. Enriched Resourcing. Speed of loading boards

Data storage

To Improve in Palo Alto monitoring Parameters. To Improve in Meraki Power Pack as many make and model missing. To add parent device in event console for any DB. Eventing console filleter issue. Need to improve or increase more no. of device to add in Dashboard as we have limit for 50 devices in one site .

The text search and replace is very crude and barely works. Needs a major revamping. The layout tabs are very clunky and hard to use. Needs to be fixed. DraftSight will fix a problem in one version, mess it up in another version, then fix it again later on. And so forth, and so forth, and so forth. Very poor software update control.

Integration is good. No issue till now

Speed of application. Organization (finding specific tasks can be difficult). Needs better integration with GitHub

Inserting images could be easier through drap and drop functionality

I find the UI clunky. We have several features that don't work (like preview or visualization icons for blocks). Updated javascript on cms is complicated. I find other platforms easier to use.

cost. lack of educated operators. lack of free sandbox systems for education

automatic infill in forms. the scrolling down function. sometimes is the screen a little bit overload with functions

interface with more platforms. more examples of project boards. Ability to share more of the functionality when exporting in excel

When exporting board to excel to keep it as it is sorted. So if I sort by level of importance it will not allow me to export that way. To move an item by dragging and dropping would be great way to organize my items.

a feature to communicate to other members of the board besides the notes would be great that way tracking of convos can be reviewed easier

Plug-in pipeline. CI/CD. Pull requests

When we use automations to send emails, it is difficult to format emails to make them look more appealing. Sometimes there is a significant lag/ delay when forwarding emails to a monday.com update.

I'll give you the feedback from the teams that use it. It's mostly related to the ease of configuring the different rule sets on the products. That's mainly the hard point there.

Campaign delivery features especially multichannel orchestration. More hosting options including offsite. Better user access and identity management controls

More support for different application level backup and recovery

I think the versions could be a clearer/cleaner feature. Automation works great but would be nice if there were some presets to give a foundation

Ease of use could be improved. Going to different boards of other members

Forms. notifications to be more highlighted. more privacy for the pro plan

Increasing the speed of the website

Legacy Application Support

Wish there was a "back" button or easier way to get back to the last screen

There's this function where in you can drag a specific item across the main table which makes an item to be misplaced and sometimes. relating to first one, I think it is much better if there's a lock function in the main table or every item that will be added on the website to make sure those items won't be misplaced and what not. the website is sometimes laggy and there are times that uploaded documents won't even load up.

Ability to delete the activities and cards faster by highlighting item to delete quicker

being able to update a project in one area and have that update transfer to the same project listed on another board.

Real-time alerts/notifications so you can respond quicker!. Improve how to rack actual attendance for "Answer a survey" for the Leaderboard. It is currently constructed on an honor system. One could answer a survey for a session they did not attend to get the points!. Letting conference registrants know how long the event will be available through the app. Instructions on how to export Bookmarked attendees and Handouts. I had to go online to find out how to export the handouts.

Too many reminders, or 'overviews'?

Moving away from the per server licensing was a big disadvantage to us

Licensing plans keep changing. Longer data history would be nice.

Handling currencies - so far there is no internal currency conversion and we keep different currencies in different accounts. More suppliers in Asian markets

The ability to do Backup copies jobs for non-object based storage. Meld the Backup and Replication application with this one

Reactivity on taking new functionalities into account. As the tool lacks functionalities if compared to older SAP versions. Purchase Orders mass log management. Business Partners mandatory fields customizing

Possibility to invite costumers in it. Summing values between columns. Basic mathematical operations between columns.

Improvements could be made around tape library and media sets. More advanced features for somethings like timeouts etc.

Time Off Requests. More FAQ's

Need to find more experience candidate rather than a fake one. Techfetch doesn't using more. kindlt improve it. getting more repeating profiles.

User interface

I think there could be some improvement with surveys, particularly building your own, we need more options and more format options as well.

Bugs occurrence is one of the issue that I have with IBM Process Mining although thier support team helps us to fix the bugs.

Maybe it could benefit of something things were simplified? It seems like it had a lot of bells and whistles that I never used, but maybe it would've been good for me to use them.

Cost - less fees would be appreciated.

Integration and consistency of the Opti PIM. Page design drag and drop can run into issues with more complex page designs.

I have been using KnowBe4 for two years now and am satisfied. I do not have any suggestions for improvements.

Adobe Acrobat Sign account recovery is slightly tedious. Usually after the updates, user gets signed out & it keeps asking us to sign-in again. Mobile interface still needs a lot of improvement. Currently, it' not smooth.

Price: The Cisco Firepower 1000 Series comes with a significant price tag. User interface: The Firepower Management Center (FMC) interface can be complex and overwhelming for some users. Performance impact especially when running multiple security modules

I honestly want Rubrik to focus on what they do best. CDM was introduced and IMO it isn't robust enough for this feature. I would like better API documentation. I'd like to see more granular control of SLA retentions.

Tax. The reps don’t seem to understand what is going on. Reports. For example, the change report with payroll has too many changes. I would like to see only what employees or administrators update. Timesheets.

The little information icon on some of the tasks can make it really hard to read what is written in the box. I wish it was easier to write out detailed instructions for tasks in a box. I have experienced times where I will create a new task and all of my information has been deleted or disappeared.

everything is clear and improved

I would like more choices for on-hold music.

So I would like the authentication authorization to be part of the main product and a way of using APL to configure this particular product so that we can open it for our DevOps guys to just configure it. And better integration with Kubernetes is another thing that we would like.

Integration dashboard. More clear connector options

UI can be improve in case you are monitoring multiple DB. Multiple monitor DB getting slow the system

More platform options like Mobile Apps. more custom features. more integration features.

Not sure if it's a monday.com thing or my lack of understanding, but using dashboards to report metrics from multiple boards.

Dashboards. Email Signature. Notifications

Need more focus on admin experience before focusing on user experience. change management communication template- help customers prepare their users for changes, and why those are happening. cleaner website and navigation. One main page/site per product solutions (incl innovation, help, communities etc). too many outdated KBAs or deleted KBAs

integrations - but these are being added pretty regularly lately. API with other products

I cannot post to an LinkedIn GROUP, only a LinkedIn page.

Can be a bit clunky when trying to move objects. Locking components is a good feature but takes too long to do it for every object you want locked. Pasting images sometimes results in error -- have to right click --> paste instead. Copying components and pasting sometimes doesn't work inside Miro

In my experience, It can be challenging at times to get solutions in place in a timely manner. In my opinion, UI is outdated. Make it easier to implement new functionality

Tables creation and navigation. Table columns always visible while scrolling. Decluttering functionality?

Communication of process changes as they change functionality. Regular communication from Account Representative. Clarity of Security Roles and how to adjust them for Admin users

Obviously Miro isn't used for data/dashboarding, but potentially something to think about from an integration standpoint. Potentially adding some interactive features for more engaging workshops. Rather than just having drag and drop.

Maybe a little bit on the automation side and if you want to script something, if you want to automate procedures, that happens through every simulation round that you have. That part could be a little bit cumbersome right now, depending on the operating system that you use. Introducing the software on other platforms like Mac OSS.

some difficulties with email automations - trouble connecting my email to my influencer outreach board. budget boards could be a little more precise and more functions. a monday.com widget for apple products

Improving performance for processing larger data. Improve the efficiency of Entity relationship. more friendlier Integration with other accelerators

The time it takes to scan large projects makes it difficult to fit into our CI/CD/pipeline. One of our app scans times out after 2 hours and we have to upload it and scan manually but there is no visibility the CI system has as to vulnerabilities found. Integration with older development languages to scan. We have old 4GL based application that is not compatible with the tools

More details and issues on Azure. More integrations with other SAAS applications

Nintex form doesn’t have SQL action for O365. Azure actions don’t allow you to get AD group members using NINTEX workflow. You can’t import a list workflow as site workflow. Extracting calendar occurance is very hard behind the workflow action.

Setting up templates

Subitem Automations - this would be so helpful. Include many apps free of charge instead of having to pay for each individual app. Allow users that are in the same domain to be guests. We work with sevaral departments and need them to interact with the system and not just be a viewer. These are temporary sponsors. Develope a simple vertical view of each task instead of scrolling side to side as in a spreadsheet.

User interface. Searching for calls with specific people. Searching for calls by department

User interface, can be cleaner. cleaner and more intuitive URL. Project codenames thru query string eg. EM-2042. User centered dashboard, e.g. highlighting projects that are overdue etc.

An option for all plans to have an alphabetize filter, especially for CRM workspaces.

The Tax Wizard in onboarding could be more intuitive. We are new to the Benefits module, support could be a little better

For mobile app users, Face unlock should be there for the faster access of stored password

For me Sage Intacct is a whole package which is very user friendly

It is performing as expected.

more items to add to the floor plan

There are a few UI tweaks that must be made. Deployment can be challenging and perplexing. For IBM AIX we require the IBM Power Hardware, we can't run on the different hardware model. Window OS connectivity is not well

It does not protect as many apps as other does. Agentless for physical server as physical backup is not working well. Higher price. After 2020, Technical support response time gets slower. Clone function is plus

Little less transparent on insights. Non-availability of standalone solutions. I understand amazon aims for cloud based solution. But having a facility with standalone will look great. Lastly, of course pricing could be more dynamic so we can only pay for what we opt for

There was some trouble when the Shopify Integration was first launched. I think that has been resolved. We are trying to use our custom tone. It seems to have trouble with that. I may need to seek more instruction on how to instruct it properly. There have been times when replies from support were too slow for our time lines.

Having edition tools (bold, italic, font size etc) in the briefing space instead of only having in the update session. In the format space we could have all the media formats available to be select as an icon

Time (GMT reporting does not help). Longer timed-files for opens (more than 30-days). Easier "Bounce" Notifications

Fluid customer support. Reliable customer support. A suitable and affordable platform for solopreneurs. More flexibility for solopreneurs in terms of what the set offers are

In my opinion, their customer service is horrible. It took 38 emails over 2 weeks simply to "resolve" that my bank account was overdrawn due to an unauthorized renewal fee for a yearly subscription, when I had never purchased a yearly subscription before. In my opinion, customer service could actually listen to the problem and respond like their customers are real people instead of giving canned, generic responses, making light of significant issue. In my opinion, not threaten to remove access to contact data in the event of their own error (such as unauthorized charges, and then, in my experience, after refunding, threatening to remove access to contact data if I didn't purchase a plan). In my opinion, not randomly change the functions on their platform that results in data loss, such as happened to me this week. In my opinion, when receiving a complaint about customer data loss: apologize or acknowledge the loss. In my opinion, reimburse a business for financial loss suffered due to, what I believe is incompetent and dishonest behavior, such as the auto-renew event last June.

Would love to be able to set auto sorts without having to create a whole board. Sometimes the automations do not work properly

Application tracking can be improved. Candidate Management can be improved. Employee data can be improved.

Pre-sales/Demos. NS2 offering needs to be closer to SAP Commercial. Innovation

Bringing in text. Miro is great for marking something up, but sometimes I want to incorporate a longer text piece and I haven't found a great way to do that yet. Using arrows to show a flow can be tricky. Being able to quickly change the size of a group of things

I9. When you place a ticket in for trouble shooting, turn around time could be shorter

In the area of social engineering - companies need to be more vigilant on access to buildings. I have seen workers enter the building in the morning and leave the door open to allow someone into the building who does not have an ID badge. And no security guard is there to manage the flow of traffic into the building in the morning. In the case of a leased building where several businesses share the building. The building owner needs a guard there to manage physical access.

Text editing and format control. Integration with MS Suite for more efficient presentations. More shapes and dynamic display tools for content management

More user ability to amend templates. Clearer help on the more complicated tasks. Differing levels of reports for users who are from non-accounting backgrounds

Customization for required fields/information based on company's needs

Reports sometimes use the same name - but are very different depending on where they’re run from. Still, we occasionally have issues related to things missed during our original product implementation. Sometimes Customer Support turnaround lags too much.

Upload speeds. More flexibility with cloud sync settings and target folder location. The mobile app could use some help.

Reporting. Call Data (Sources). Call transfers

Limited Control. Cost Transparency. Lack of Support for Certain Database Engines. Improved Data Migration Tools. Switch to Encrypted RDS from Unencrypted RDS

Learning security and reporting. RBPs

Simplified Licensing and Pricing Models. Advanced Data Analytics and Insights. Deeper Integration with Cloud-Native Services. Enhanced Compliance and Auditing Features

Fine tuning the AI models can be a bit difficult and has a steep learning curve. The tool is very pricey. The tool lags at times and sometimes the main sever running it needs to be rebooted

The interface is not intuitive. Trying to navigate the toolbars on the left side, based on project or department is difficult. The hierarchy for the company projects is cumbersome and hard to determine what is a task and what is a larger project, and what are subtasks. I don't like the name. It pronounces like Reich, which has such a bad connotation.

Setting up an MRR structure was difficult for us but doable with their assistance

Turnaround. Coordination with benefits department. Coordination with Wex. Chat interface. Ability to solve problems

From my personal experience as a developer, I think Adobe has a lot of work to do with their documentation. certain things they're very strong and they're very like they detail things out great. Other things that haven't been updated since like 2018 don't work anymore and it requires a lot of trial and error to actually figure out what needs to happen. A lot of the time you rely on other AEM developers inside in the inside the community forums that basically have to say, these instructions don't work, has anyone actually gotten this to work? And other people that have done the work and figured out how it actually works have kind of filled in those gaps. So it's great that those exist but it would be great if those holes never existed in the first place and Adobe's documentation really just was robust enough and didn't have typos and really got refined more frequently. So from my experience, that's definitely where I think Adobe could really improve the work experience because it shortens development time, it makes my work a lot easier, which means I can deliver things way faster and things move a lot quicker because I hate having to say I'm doing it the way Adobe says I should do it, but it doesn't work still so I need to figure out what's wrong. that's not a fun thing to have to talk to a client about because then they get confused and are confused why Adobe isn't working the way it should be. it just creates kind of some tighter timelines and things.

Hard to find the power of the tool if you do not use it often enough. Out of the box features are sometimes just shy of what you need

depending on format of training, additional languages not available. PhishRIP needs to be more flexible in their search features.

Simplify payroll processing

Some of new vendors added lot of new features in very short time. Some other large vendors provided suite of integrated enterprise software platform.

Properly implementing security can be challenging for new users. Administrative tools are not always intuitive

Timetracking reports. Turning public the backlog. More utilities for extract information. Personalized widgets (with our code without or low code)

GUI design. Reporting. Admin experience

price. space

The new updated portal when released was very difficult to use. The customer support via phone is not always on par. Email support when used could be a bit quicker when responding. CyberGraph implementation is taking too long. Feature requests should not take that long to complete.

Integration with other tools like smartsheets or Jira. Turn on specification notifications for projects. Separate notifications (inbox, approvals). Org Charts or at least see what team a person belongs to

The way stats are calculated for users based on reviews left by clients, they seem to not be adding up correctly. It will say there are 3 reviews but you can only find one. Perhaps a way to automatically assign chats to create a Q and balance among employees. Even more gifs!!

The mass email sends tend to lag, where not everyone receives the same email during the same time of day

being able to set billing according to need. WFM has a lot of steps

Subdivisions on the divisions for better organization. More plugings. More options for payments

When updating saved searches make sure to send only contacts within the saved geographical location of the search.

Within the same organization all should be allowed to start the meeting. Outside the organization, firewall restrictions should be easier. Browser meeting should be as easy as the app one

I see no areas that need improved

Would love to have a calendar feature that would link up to hire dates for our employees. I'm looking for a way to have automations set up to remind users of when 6 month and annual reviews are due.

customer service really needs to be better. your employees do not come off as experts when call in for guidance. hard to use - setting up events

Outdated data on contacts.

Not sure about this

Interface. Workflow trigger variety

Integrations with personalization products at Optimizely (on the roadmap with Optimizely One).

Even more insights into who clicked on our content and where

Veeam can be daunting to initially install and set-up.

Upgrades to vCenter tend to mess my backup data and jobs up. The ability to link a VM in the old vCenter to the same VM in the new vCenter.

Less cluttered viewing and layout for some drop downs when projects are task heavy. Notification organization when tags or mentions happen. Use for more plug ins, integrations

You should be able to click enter without the message sending. Sometimes a read messages remains unread

simplicity. integration. flexibility with out of the box reporting

The team is dedicated to offer reliable skills. I have acquired a lot and I cannot complain.

They might consider merging Cognos Analytics, Planning Analytics, Cognos Controller into single subscription. The same will reduce confusion. There is initially a steep learning curve despite no coding knowledge needed. Try to make the learning process easier.

Requires time for training to get started with it. Need better and detailed documentation for debugging. UI could be made a little more intuitive

It is only available as cloud based and lack mobile apps for iOS and Android systems.

It's probably error management in that sort of sense with digging into the detail when the problems do arise, getting into the nitty gritty and when the customers have customized it gets really complicated. So it's indicating where we should not go down the route, the customization because we have always tried to not customize but you do and then it messes it all up or makes the support difficult.

Editing Features. Ease of use. Integration of other apps

I do not like that fact that SAP Master Data Governance lack mobility support. There’s deficiency in documentation for features available online.

Honestly, at this time I think it does what I need it to do and I don't see any areas for improvement.

Integration of it apart from Amazon ecosystem is a bit hard. Due to it is NoSQL, you can perform join and other operations. Limited Storage option

So far I haven't had any issues

direct connection should be working every single time seamlessly

Onboarding has lots of room of improvements and alignment with EC. Onboarding forms little complicated and also customer cannot change on fly it’s in process by Onboardee or Managers

Wish I could vary the column titles for my various projects without having to open another file. More color selections on the cell filler options. Wish I could permanently separate the fields by closure (per quarter)

An equivalent of a Google Sheet page would be welcome. A simple, multiple user calendar. One in which Annual Leave could be easily mapped.

Builds on Adobe platform so it is easy to utilize, but many features require enterprise subscription. Integrations available but your CRM integration is only available with enterprise license. Lots of templates but there are additional templates with enterprise only and there was no drag and drop editor. Adobe captures some analytical metrics but many of the analytics we required were not available - specifically metrics related to how the tool converts and reduces use time by our team and the impact on clients.

must be hosted in the cloud, no on-premise option.

Cannot do a points drop off system - drops all points at one time (not from its occurrence. FMLA with Time & Labor does not transfer to HR & Payroll (have to manually track)

Sharing a public preview isn't intuitive. UI is complex. Link checks aren't always accurate

one improvement could be easily adding users to the training rather then whole group. Another thing is I have to manually select the level of subscription we have in order to filter out trainings specific to our level. I think it would be ideal if it was setup to be default

Seated shows could have additional functionality. Additional permission options. Single sign on

It can be hard to get full buy in from your team to create cards

Quite hard to implement alongside existing security tools

Feature tour at update would be nice

filters on report. filters on dashboard. improving UX for timesheet. make some easy solutions or setup for timesheet reporting

Give me bootable media for building immutable storage from scratch. Linux backup proxy VM's, keep making these easier and better. Make it all linux based including management

When you can add viewers to boards and set it so that they can only see the pulses they are assigned to, they shouldn't be able to see all the groups!

When jobs fail sometimes the errors can be very cryptic. Upgrading to new versions can be a headache. Requires a cluster of servers

I would love to see nested folders in the segment creation and campaign folder structures. Our sales team would like to see a contact reporting hierarchy. Please make it so we can export list names as a field into Salesforce or export a list to a campaign. Our sales team would like to be able to easily add their exported list to a Groove campaign. Alternatively, a Groove integration would be even better.

Screenshots of related items. Card suggestions linked to a topic. Bookmarked article for easy access

it feels a bit busy at times. there's lots of irrelevant features to us that we'd rather not see. it would be nice if the columns didnt have to be the same for each group, item, and subitem - different sub items/items need different statuses

Some more FAQ. A more instant helpdesk. Make the UI have more contrast

Posting internal employee information.

The search is not always intuitive to users who don't use it frequently. The AI tool should help with that. Tracking creators of cards - when someone else verifies a Guru Card, they become the "Author". The Chrome extension is occasionally a bit temperamental.

Ns2 support is challenging when modules are housed and supported by SAP SuccessFactors. Typically this created lags in understanding the the correct resources within SAP SuccessFactors. Ns2 adoption of latest software can create significant gap’s I functionality availability to ns2 example people analytics

Customer service. App software. Optimization

Working with regular expressions could be enhanced in my opinion. Also REST & SOAP workflow actions could be improved.

everything about the mobile app

Lack of open source support compared to GitHub. In browser IDE experience is not fully seamless. Lack of cross platform support

Additional custody provider

I would love to see a roll up feature integrated to sync boards automatically based on a drop down box, rolling up the information into a dashboard per client or job. It would be nice to have the ability to change the list format per group and just link the columns that need to communicate.

Schema update was challenging, but it is difficult for RDBMS in general

Security Roles. Updating Dynamic Assignments. Support. But that may really be more about our contract with a reseller.

Would be good to move the divider between the sidebar and boards themselves -- some board names are long, we can't see them in their entirety. Would love to see a general/main way to add notes to a board -- and/or group -- about a project. We like having boards with tasks, but there's no place to pin a note at the top that would be useful to refer to. Do more with the HubSpot integration

Ease of use for those not familar

Room to expand on project management.

Jobs metadata to be available in Snowflake. Error messages some times are not so clear. Job Optimization recommendation

Searching for a particular entry within a long compounded JE. Auto logout is irritating

Cross-Region Automated Backups. More Granular Backup Retention Policies. Schema Version Control.

our company doesn't have access to many options, so I cannot say. I just know I really enjoy this CRM platform compared to others.

Notifications and follow up on chats. spam inbox is not always spam. manage it since the beggingn

I would like to be able to calculate totals at the bottom of a column to include sales tax

Internal linking recommendations. Bulk exports of data. Data visualization

Some of the features are not as intuitive as Id like to see.

Speaker Resource Center. Data tags in Session descriptions. 15 minute idle before getting logged out

More complex analytics when creating a dashboard. A simple connection with boards to automate tasks between areas. More functions when creating columns in boards

I am pleased overall with this product!

The Recruiting feature has given us many issues.

Employee retention. in person conferences. smarter functions. live networking trainings on different functions/products

Desktop app. Side by side experiment comparison (tabs)

Visual flowcharts would be a nice addition. A more colorful UI. Better customer support.

Reporting/Story Reports. Onboarding 2.0. Contingent Workforce Module within EC

Direct phone calls were not arriving from external callers. Internal calls could not be transferred. Process for approving SMS messaging was cumbersome and confusing.

I don't like because the updates are very heavy and very expensive. This is the main issue we have.

Remove preview limits!. Do more bootcamp. Make review group for several email client

Paylocity tries to stay ahead of competitors with services offered but fails to ensure services function exceptionally well. Customer service is lacking. 'Call center' style customer service instead of dedicated rep that knows your company's system set up. Issues take too long to resolve - often months for a resolution. Sometimes no resolution due to system limitations

More customization. Email reminder options.

Command Center availability with VMware. More proactive touch points. Recommendations based on monitoring, proactively

Implementing new feature requests. Better multi-level folder structuring. Better integrated diagramming on tasks.

Better filtering of opportunities. More timely notification of opportunities. A comprehensive view of government entity profile including contacts, contracts, vendors, rfp's, etc.

additional features to continue enhancing user experience.

Form designing. Enhanced workflow automation. Improve the ease of Integration with RPA

manual or guide when selecting alternative signer

I think there always could be easier ways to build apps with Mendix, and I think they tend to be doing a very good job. I haven't seen the new Mendix 10 yet, but I've heard some about it and they've implemented a lot of improvements, AI features, and other things. So we look forward to using those features as we get more experience with Mendix 10.

Tags could be automatically arranged, even if not put in order manually.

Make it easier for new users. Provide one stop service. Training

excel sheet management. data visualization. Report and dashboard

Better export feature for Excel

Customer Service. I want to be able to directly get in contact with someone who can help me. Currently, I have to go through HRIS who will then submit a help ticket. It's a whole process, and I don't get a quick response. I want answers to my questions when I have them.

Reporting is good but could be easier to setup

Adding new entities into existing grouped account recs. Bulk re-assignment of journal masters. Ability to select specific journal masters to run to create child journals

I would say with the OSS just because there's been a lot of bugs that have been affected. Now I know some of this is not Cisco's fault, but some of this Cisco has put out bugs, just some of the customers haven't upgraded. But I'd say with the OSS is just trying to get that a little figured out better.

Building Reports. to be able to process more personalize reports to generate information

Pricing. UI is intuitive but powerful features require deeper knowledge of SQL

It is hard to copy another board to use as a basis for a new one. To fix something it is difficult and requires starting over on some parts. We wish it could be more geared to adding files of music or videos onto each board

Out-of-the-box messaging clients for operational and test support

System manager. Some inventory management. Configuration settings is not easy task

Layout. Font

Adding chat. Nothing else.

Reporting options. Include union processes. Include two way texting options in Recruiting

Moving more than one job at a time within a group on a board

Don't have an example of an improvement

Customer Service. Depth. Detailed Information

The Search function is limited, it can take some time to find the right footage. The site can get hung up occasionally. Searching collections and similar shots could be improved.

The different spaces can be confusing. Project plan titles do not appear on the to do list view. when I change dates on a task that has subtasks, the subtasks sometimes don't automatically adjust even though I check the box for that to happen

Basically more API integration. The more, the better. I mean, we like to see a lot more cloud management tools on there.

Reports are too complex. ADP WFN and eTime sometime do not work well together

Enhanced Test Scripting. Improved mobile testing. AI Integration

Tools to communicate as a team; discussion boards that can be linked to tasks, but can be their own stand-alone group discussion boards more so for "brainstorming" new ideas. More automation recipes, mostly with subitems. Ability to edit/change/reorganize automation recipes. I want to be able to re-arrange the order of the subitems that come up under a new item (that are part of a custom automation recipe). We use subitems as our "checklist" of the repetitive tasks for each item(client) and we want the checklist (subitems) to be in the proper order that we normally would complete each task. When we think of a new repetitive task to add to this checklist after the fact, the whole recipe must be rewritten to correct the order.

Standardized processes and journeys can improve.

Faster uploading and downloading of attachments. More user-friendly approver feature. Improve the comment box section

In my experience, occasionally get error message that's vague saying "Something went wrong" but it does not really go into the what part of that error message. In my experience, sometimes the page does not load although it can sometimes be resolved by refreshing the page or trying again to load the page. I wish that the integration with Google sheets would include line hyperlinks to the files that are uploaded through our photo upload form. In my experience, it just gives the URL which would need to be pasted into a browser.

The user interface has too many options. Sometimes it becomes difficult to find out so many available options. Mobile application sometimes crashes on iOS. You can't tag a person who is not on the monday.com Platform

Integration with our SSO software could be more seamless. Collapsible images would be a nice feature

Inventory Process. Editing POs after a month. Editing inventory items after original creation

Slight learning curve. Deployment can be tricky at first. UI could be better.

Price should be competitive or product price should decrese. Needs to improve support services. Proper and clear usage documentation should be provided

The cost of adding emojis is preventative.

reports on communications performance. more customization. improve usability when creating tours

It would be nice if Website tools were part of the main offering rather than additional

So one is it does what it does. I mean load balancing pretty well. But I think when it comes to distributor denial of service, I think it needs to sort of have a little more breakdown on the products that are affordable. It's very expensive to have a distributed denial service solution. If you could implement distributed denial service features at a low-balancer level, that would be awesome. I don't think any company has achieved it successfully. But because this brand has a background in these kinds of products, I'm pretty sure you can come up with something that we are looking for.

I find it virtually impossible to access people when you have issues with anything. In my experience, everything runs through account managers and they are non-responsive and unavailable most of the time. In my experience, 99% of all communication with anybody at Avalara has to be done via some ridiculous form or via email. Human contact is extremely difficult to resolve an issue that sometimes requires human to human contact.

Charts have some room for improvement, especially regarding the labeling. For those team members who are not used to project management, sometimes the details can be overwhelming. Notifications frequency can be annoying sometimes

UI can be "busy" sometimes. Global block/allow lists sometimes don't work as expected

When u leave it for long enough it get disconnected. GUI Not loos friendly. Reporting not good

Having to clear cookies & cache in order to use Guru - have to press enter when searching rather than it auto populating as you type

Unknown system outages that are during normal working hours (once every couple months it will be down for 3-4 hours). Site map doesn't allow for specific landing pages. For example, invoicing: I'd prefer to be able to have a "favorite" be for either subcontractors or owners. Drawings functions are not user friendly when needing to do estimation takeoffs

More of an environment issue, but better support for sizing and speed problems. Live migrations status bars..seems like the final 1 to 2% functions take the longest as I watch for them to finish. I know the step we are at, but it takes so long as you are waiting for the last bit to complete (VM RAM and system state) . I know they do not know the exact sizing, and it is the last 1 step of the 99 it did, but I get antsy

Reporting. Onboarding. Auto pay calculations

I don't see much that I would change. It works very well and the more complicated an app becomes, the harder it is to use. It already has a lot of features. It has even kept the FTP option if it's needed.

Initial training could have been given more time. Position Management was not thoroughly reviewed, and we have come to realize that this is a major system driver. A lot of the initial set up was done for us, which seemed great at the time, but when it came time for us to handle items, we struggled. The cost is higher than most other systems and the billing is very confusing

They could accept the money in Israel instead of having to made transfer to their US bank. They should support every business transaction including drop shipping. They are quite expensive (the fix monthly charge)

More tutorials. Become more intuitive

Integrating with other operating platforms. More customization

The dashboard function is not really useful for our projects since we can't really use the custom fields to build them. It would be nice if the reports generated could be converted into graphs in Wrike. I wish we had the option of customizing which custom fields are to appear on the face of each project

Licensing, our perpetual license was forcefully removed from us after 8 years without warning, causing a doubling of the price, after providing a signed sales quote for renewal through our VAR. Parallels sales team did not seem to care, and was willing to throw away a customer who used their services for nearly a decade, and throw our VAR under the bus. continued addition of new features for existing platforms, not just a focus on the hot new cloud offerings.

quicker loading time. Mobile friendly user face , some features dont work on the mobile app. Track employee locations

I would like to have more audiences. Phone support for standard plan. Allow to use our subdomain without buying from mail chimp

Cost is a bit high for a single license, but this is a full featured application.

The query limitation, the service allow query on index, but not allow if index not available. Table join is not available , which is difficult for complex queries. Size limit on storage capacity

Sizing of sticky notes. Stickers

I'd like to see yet more configuration options for the dashboard. Add a risk matrix template. Add "knowledge packs' - things such as go to market strategy, pricing strategy. change management, BPO, etc. to give users a fully immersive "one-stop shop"

Speed (in development). Continue developing 3.0, releases are exciting. Not much else comes to mind

Easier ability to create Teams. Oversight by upper management via specific location assignments

Constant updates that are hard to keep up with. Difficult implementation process that did not leave me feeling prepared to administer the system. Not very responsive help provided

Errors on EC to ECP/PNR intergration. Mass data changes are difficult. System business rules and configurations are challenging to use and learn

The way rules are built could use better documentation. Java-Applets are not the best way to implement changes in forms, etc. The UI could use a modernization

Pricing needs to be lowered. Adding accounts is sometimes complicated. Analytics reporting could be made easier and provide more details on posts. They just changed the username linking for multiple platforms and it creates more work!

Flexibility as any CMS on the market

Development CRM - not intuitive and needs a lot of customization. It is very difficult to receive focused support. Formatting in attached Word files gets distorted if right-to-left (Hebrew) and left-to-right (English) languages are used in the same file

IBM Cloud Hyper Protect DBaaS

Ability to apply automation or notifications to tasks right within the dashboard.

I work in Bio-technology. They have introduced nice Healthcare templates and props to use. However, if they can keep adding props and templates to the scientific area that would be of use to me. The timeline can sometimes be a little hard to read, particular if you add features. The music selection is limited. If they could add more music to the audio selection that would be good. I love the text to speech but it can be time consuming to add to every frame. If they can make this easier it would be good.

While the platform is accessible on mobile devices, improving the mobile app's functionality and user experience would be beneficial.

It doesn't have built-in email marketing tools like some of the more expensive competitors. It doesn't have optical character recognition for adding business card data, a scan input function would be nice. That's about all I've found is missing

I do the same 4-6 competitors every quarter, so ideally it would prompt me when the earnings transcripts are available. In ideal world, it would provide a summary of key points from the earnings transcripts.

can't think of any for our environment

The product could be improved by expanding the ability to screen for insider buying/selling. It would be helpful to be able to get a summary of insider transactions for a given company on a weekly basis just to identify any material changes. It would be helpful for the product to provider blacklines for international (non-USA) companies. I find the USA blackline reports especially helpful, as I can quickly see what wording has changed from the previous filing. However, the blacklines appear to not be available for European companies. Lastly, peer and larger customer information would be helpful to have on a concise screen. Some filings mention material (>10% of sales) customers. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a pre-arranged option to see the material customers for a given company. As this would be based on a word search, I think the preset option (i.e., material customers) would be possible to add as a feature to Alphasense.

A more streamlined approach for non-licensed users might help even more

User Interface to be developed(UI). System performance to be developed. Has a limitation for adding the number of equipment

Data could be structured more for actionable insights

In my experience, they allow scamming on their site, freelancers ripping clients off. In my opinion, their Customer Support don't take disputes seriously. In my experience, Upwork removes written reviews

It's an standard DB

The quick search button is not immediately visible on the main page.

The amount of time it takes customer service and or tech support takes to get back when issues arise. Communicating with one drive, SharePoint, Dropbox or secure share at times to retrieve documents needed. Not force changes or updates on users until they wish to implement them.

More Features. Functionality. More personalization

I find things mostly intuitive now, but there was certainly a learning curve at the beginning. I wish there was a more in-your-face short training or introductory video that I could have shared with my team before jumping in. There was a lot of trial and error. More templates! I love the social media planner template, but wish there were additional options to choose from. I wish that there was a way to add tasks assigned to the team to appear on my "My Work" page, without adding individual's tasks as well.

Showing more than one week at a time on the timecard view. Back arrow takes you too far back. Can't fully get rid of project rows from timecard; hit "remove" and it still comes back the next time

LMS - might be lack of knowledge on our part, but inability to create learning journeys/paths across multiple learning catalogs in a clean, user friendly way

The navigation controls for reviewing video are quite good for an online platform, but the instructions for a non-video professional should be right there on the review screen. Wish there was a way to use embed codes on the hosted videos so they could be embedded on our website portfolio page (or others).

Shorten times required to obtain assistance with issues. Improved training during onboarding. Better understanding that not everyone understands ADP and industry terminology and information at same levels so when speaking to people you must understand your audience and adjust accordingly. You can't instruct with resolutions as if helping coworker that has same level of knowledge as you when person has little to no understanding of what you are referring to leading to mutual frustration and no resolution of issues..only poor experiences.

The API is hard to understand and you need to often "chain" API calls

Integration with DEP or Apple could be made easier but it works fine once connected. Support could be improved as it was a little complicated for some administrators who are not considered super admins. IBMid is still an issue for my account since I am an administrator on a server that is owned and managed by our USA division but I support Canada which does not have its own server

A little more flexibility in the multi-location and/or consolidation setup would help. Lacks the ability to apply "Event correction" settings on specific product groups or categories, it can currently only be applied to all or nothing.

Price per license. Asset Portfolio Management. OKRs

Lack of sophistication in email templates

notification are heavy and things can get lost. my work section can become cluttered. deadlines are glitchy to input

Create videos for social media. Create Gifs. Newsletter templates that are not HTML but copy/paste code.

Easier forms. Move to "completed" without delays. Organization in file tabs

User interface. Version control. Repository

Colour-coding in charts (based on different filters). Create a view mode of the dashboard from other people's perspectives. Be able to integrate two boards to create one single widget chart

backend architecture is complicated

automation. automation. automation (calendar function)

Some of the payment summaries created by system we cant edit and modify as per client requirment if we can it ll be very usefull. Sandbox Access should include all activities with real time data

Response time

helping clients with reconfiguration

Better options for searching for and sorting components. More label options for visualizations and freeform tables. Exporting more than 50,000 rows

Hard to identify event source of incidents being reported. Reporting can be confusing and difficult to get right. Hard to keep on top of incident reports

Based on source tool hierarchy, need view into the parent/child relationship. Export of data into the companys format for reporting up

The look is clunky and outdated. It is a bit hard to navigate.

Quicker response times to support tickets. More advanced functionality of subitems. monday.com docs could be great, but we've had lots of glitches/issues with them

Ability to simulate the preview on different devices. Statistical significance estimate in the report seems to fluctuate often, with no context or update on what changed and why

Complicated design. Learning curve - explain how to use it in clearer ways

Executive Project summaries can be more detailed. Distortion while using in mobile browsers. Project Analytics have missing elements such as 'Individual Resource performance'.

Connection with other platforms. Employee Central linkage to internal employee applications. Dashboard reports

if we could decrease the costing via some kind of sampling of errors. sometimes same error is in loop and Sentry will count all the events for pricing if there is any way this can be reduced. self hosted capabilities or using own storage to reduce cost.

Need to access the site in order to share the URL of a project plan with a client/would be nice to do this directly from the app. Would be great to receive alerts - if something is past due/etc.

Our site has about 250,000 definitions pages on dictionary.com. We've got about 150,000 synonym pages across the source.com. So very high volume of pages. As you can imagine, most of these are pretty low traffic. You've got maybe that top 5%, 10% are really driving a huge amount of traffic, but then you have all these really obscure things out there. There's still a lot of important information you can get there and oftentimes in our Adobe Analytics reporting suite, it'll kind of bundle things at low traffic at a pretty low threshold for us to get to. So that can be a limitation when we're trying to do some really detailed keyword analysis. The way we've gotten around that is we make use of the data feed and the export. So we make the data available to our analyst in more of that raw state. So when they really do need to truly get into that weeds data, we don't run into that low traffic limitation.

time off set up for employees

UX needs to be rethought. In my opinion, text is very small and often not intuitively laid out. In my opinion, better integration with other Optimizely products: expectation is that it should dovetail into ODP, CMS, content recommendations and Delivera. In my opinion the current stack integration is not cohesive. In my opinion, library needs to be improved with more of a Finder or File-system-like interface. In my opinion, it's very hard to organize assets that have been placed in the top-level folder by default. Better search based on file name and content would also be helpful. In my opinion, there's a big gap between a collaborator and a guest.

Easier way to sign in. Access important documents easier. Nothing else

Integration with accounting system requires manual intervention periodically to restore accurate ledger data

Outlook app often disconnects on it's own. No ability for a combined deal with customer view. Minor glitches from time to time (but they do a great job of letting you know it's a known issue on the site and that it's being worked on)

Nexus Dashboard should merge views from Cisco ACI and NXos into one common Dashboard. Nexus Dashboard should have a history of searching for information about the indicated endpoints. Nexus Dashboard for ACI should have possibility to check compliance wit best practice implementations

Automated Backup and recovery is a complex feauture, this needs to be simple as it is one of the most important feauture. Transactions limit needs to be increased, currently it is around 20-25 unique items. Cost estimation is hard and challenging

seems like I hit "dead ports" a lot of the time when I initially connect. ability to silence participants cna be difficult to find "on the fly". not sure if integration with apps like Gong is available? The ability to record should be built-in

Carrier feed visibility. Self taught courses for learning opportunities

Lacks some more robust features as compared to competitors (ie Dropbox). Lacks “online only” storage. Lacks more advanced sharing and online file viewing features. Lacks a “Transfer” feature (a la Dropbox or WeTransfer)

runs only on windows s.o. hungry for ram. a bit expensive

So a couple of things that are missing. So it doesn't do everything that Cisco, the main Cisco Catalyst Switches do, but it's pretty comparable. We found a couple features that it just didn't have, it didn't have a particular multicast version. There's a couple little things it didn't do, but overall it's good. I mean, for our use case it works well, but there are some limitations.

Continuous performance management. More hands on content on people analytics. Good documentation without overwhelming the users with data

The user interface. Quicker support on issue tickets. More detailed error codes for some of the generic errors

The messaging journey, rather than going via various screens - would be good to have them in a single page. Would be good to know if the Product supports WatchOS And Android watch notifications

More personalization. Hover over notes to see the body instead of having to click it. Being able to open notes as pop-ups. More effective task organization. Allow for team members to remove tasks from set stages when not applicable

The ability to upvote cards. Better duplicate card detection. Ability to integrate with more software

The search results aren't always great. There's a lag in email updates. When you try to add an email's text to a project using the CC URL, it doesn't always work. Not very "clean' look on left side

Larger size file sharing. Longer meeting time for trial version. Use on mobile

Workflow. Reporting

Expand your offerings into more categories

option to put the device in a separate rack. some buttons could be better situated. access directory

Better 3rd party integration for reporting (direct Google Sheets). Improvements on RBAC. OpenSearch Reserved Instances recommendations do not exist

Decent learning curve. Some support staff seem more knowledgeable than others.

Continuous Performance management - it is not user-friendly and employees/managers do not use it even though we have enabled it and trained. Executive Review for Calibration. It needs to have more edit functionality and not just dashboard material

In my experience, reporting is a problem, especially if courses are assigned to an individual, but the individual is assigned to a team. In my experience, the team lead cannot generate a team quick report and see all the courses assigned on the individual level. Allowing the expiration date of a LP to be changed via a team. Many of the parameters, like expiration date, emails are on the course level. It would be nice if these features were on the people level.

UI with artificial intelligence. Reporting

The security models have solved our challenges. The system has performed beyond our expectations.

Multi-Language Support. Mobile SEO Optimization. Advance Reporting and Analytics

Reseller Portal could use some work, but has been improving

Payment transfers. Time of payment verfication. Huge fees

Its not that easy it needs support of experts. It doesn’t track the apps on url base

Capacity and Demand Management - Allowing for specific criteria and future forward planning. Automated notifications for new work and/or approvals

needs more defined access roles to the system. HR doesn't need same access as accounting, but it does need some items that are restricted under the accounting role.

The search function: makes it difficult to search for items and documents without getting the codes exactly correct. A suggested search feature would be beneficial. The BOM export function could be refined to allow users to specify which file type they specifically want exported (eg. PDFs, Word, STEP). Further traceability for lot numbers/ serial numbers in the quality world.

We are having issues with deployment in Dubai and the Middle-East

Reporting. Access for survey results. Automated notifications when a survey is submitted

Grouping of boards

Graphs. Dashboards. Messaging

Automatic company updating when a contact person is assigned. When a company is listed show the company contacts first

Offline mode!!!

So silly, but have a color picker :). Show groups clearer (maybe dots around which are grouped together) not frames. Frame name freedom! Want to have no name some name, emoji name, picture name!

workflows a limited. block publishing if shared. DNS management for complex enterprise domain hosting (some part of our www. going to Optimizely Content Management System but not all)

The upload utility can still be made simple. The user management interface can be made more user friendly. Defect Management features to be added.

instant chat feature

contributor's interface

It takes a little bit of work to really get your head around how to structure content in Guru. It's not the worst I've dealt with, to be sure, but certainly an area I've seen growth in Guru over the past decade. Guru knows that their sweet spot is internal knowledge management .. and they are the best at it. I do wish that they would get (back) into public KBs as well. Having public-facing cards would be a huge win. That being said, it's hard to argue with success. I'd like to see better integration with Microsoft products, especially Dynamics 365.

More training is needed to get familiar with the app.

Not terribly intuitive. It was difficult to get buy-in, ClickUp is typically the first thing an employee neglects when they get busy. Occasionally glitchy, and things don't work. Reloading the webpage typically fixes it, but it's annoying to have to do that. The desktop app was especially glitchy so I stopped using it. That was a year ago, perhaps it's gotten better.

Support other vendor hardware security tokens. More price competitive

Documentation needs to be more clarified since it can be confusing for beginners. Notification alert message templates need to be simplified

File/board management. Alligning objects between each other. Have more shapes for diagramming

Documentation should be expanded. If video related training is added it is great.

Speed of page. Adopting accelerators

Workflow automation could be simpler. Clear understanding and simple usage of the prospecting platform. Tasks can be a bit confusing

Truly, I have nothing negative to say about this system!

Expiration Dates on Gift Cards. Credit Card Processing Fee. Set-up Verification is a little overkill

Documentation and User Guides. Data Export and Integration. Issues with Data Syncing using Connectors

faster support

Support. less restrictions

keyboard shortcuts/key commands: consistency of the existing ones + ability to assign custom key commands. navigation in the content manager: shortcut keys, expand/collapse all, remember position, filtering. more features for tables, e.g. table templates

Mobile Experience. Offline Access. Better Integration with Third-Party Tools

UI Interface

It is difficult to rectify the errors or mistakes we made in the past and it takes much time to edit it. It doesn't work in offline mode which creates time wastage when there are some internet crashes. It is quite expensive when the work of the organization is small. It is very easy to make many costly mistakes because of lack of audit trails

Currently limited only to Microsoft Azure. Would love to see the functionality expanded to other clouds.

The SMS portion goes down often. I would move the approve and deny options to ensure it requires different interactions each time.

Offer letters. Zoom Integration. More Customer level configuration

swipe function for left and right swiping. credit card integration. integration with QuickBooks

Reporting and Analytic at the resource level. Capturing history - after progressing runs it wipes out who did what hard to know to to have conversations with. Slowness - switching screen the load takes an eternity. Customer Success Center do not produce answers to match my question.

Provide better customer support. Cost Optimisation Suggestion

The interface is a bit clunky. It can be slow at times

Delay in introducing expected features. scalability. Compatibility with other migration tools

Zoom Phone does not have Fax support..

Benefits. Open Enrollment. Life Changes

Accounting integrations with QuickBooks Online would be nice

Add a contact us page to the website. These people are impossible to reach.

risks, dependency, issue integration with PPM Pro

One small disadvantage is that the mobile app has fewer features than the web interface. It is primarily handy for viewing process maps while on the go. Another minor drawback is that, based on the complexity of your operations, the process of onboarding and setup may require a considerable amount of time, necessitating several weeks of onboarding activities. Finally, a handful of the third-party integrations felt functionally tacked on. But, the basic product works flawlessly.

In my opinion, not user friendly at all. I think it has to many steps to correct issues. some issues not fixable

Combine containers usage information with costs in a single dashboard. Dynamic temporal filters (last x days)

Information resource can be confusing at times

Building reports is not intuitive, especially the filter features. Most of the time I create a report that has way too much information and I have to go through and delete what I don't need. As an HR professional, it's tough not being able to do some things myself - like adjusting PTO hours if needed. Though I understand that many companies using TriNet may not have anyone in HR or people without a lot of experience, so it is ultimately to protect their clients.

The visual builder is glitchy and doesnt save changes sometimes. The code editor has low contrast and is uncomfortable to code in. The control+f sucks and half of the time the result is underneath the control+f overlay

In displaying the effective dates for pay rates, it would seem more beneficial to display on form 1 rather than selecting another area to review the effective date.

If Listclean can verify phone numbers that would be great!

improve implementation process. quality control

It has to improve linux restores both file and vm. IBM i back ups are not possible at this moment. Backups for VMware is ultimate but for Nutanix needs improvement

Gant chart interface could be a bit better to navigate

Need automated triggered checklists

more lenience with uploaded observations when the feature tables don't fully match the feature set that the deployed model trained on. Instead of simply erroring out, provide prompts for in-place fixes. null correlation analysis (how often two columns are missing values at the same time) would be very useful to help identify a different type of data relationship.

Should be able to communicate with outlook. Should be real-time in collaboration

I/O costs are incurred. Not fully MySQL compatible especially if you’re using something very specific to mysql. Might hit the upper limit on max number of connections

Read receipts. Quicker delivery times. Doesn't feel instant. Status should be automated for "online", "away", etc.

As with many VOIP providers, they've grown so much that their training, online knowledgebase and customer service hasn't quite kept up with demand. Having said this, I haven't needed to reach customer service because their product is so solid.

I can’t think of anything specific

Square 9 Softworks isn't hard to use, so no improvement necessary. The functionality of Square 9 Softworks more than meets my needs, so no improvement necessary. Square 9 Softworks should continue delivering a top notch product

over-inclusion of fees, assessments in new jurisdictions that truly are not applicable to the services we provide. Provide the ability to see what justifications or applicable code applies to why a fee may be assessed so that users can review.

Hypervisor Support. Expand Cloud replication provider support

Missing documentation. view is hard to see in one

I guess the ability to gather data as far as specifics that we need in our industry, and I'm only speaking of our group being able to see average channel time shrinkage in a real-time state. I think that's probably where it comes through as we need more robust technology on it, because right now in the version that we're using, we don't really see it in real-time. We kind of get it afterwards, maybe 15 minutes, 30 minutes later.

Work Assignment changes when updating a primary work assignment. Better communication when working on open service tickets for EDI.

Cross functionality between boards. Not importing signature images into Files section

A case study on other companies who implemented this solution. More how-to guides. Be nice to have this integrated with our internal software

Customer service. Billing. Sunsetting of features

The ability to see outgoing emails with Gmail. The ability to bring attachments into ChurnZero from Salesforce

Improve Response time. Add write replica for scaling. database caching

The standard Anaplan integration tool (Anaplan Connect) seems very archaic compared to other available tools in the market and does not have the ability to transform data prior to it being ingested into Anaplan. They do offer another tool that does a better job and is more user friendly but it is for a fee. However, they will be introducing something called Data Management System in the next few months which is very promising and seems to be something that will handle all the things that an ETL tool does and more!. Calculations at various levels of a dimension can be tricky and requires more effort for a model builder. I have personally seen other tools make calculations at any level of a dimension so much more easy to build which in turn makes the drill through of those calculations less complicated and more easily understood by users. Would be great if Anaplan can improve on this area. Companies requiring very large transactional data sets to be used in Anaplan have the option of using a different calculation engine called "Polaris" which allows larger "sparse" models to be built and can work side-by-side with the traditional Anaplan engine. Companies needing these very large models built may then have to have models built using the traditional calculation engine (for smaller, dense models) as well as the new Polaris engine (for larger, sparse models) which will make the model build a bit more challenging. Having said this, I haven't yet seen an existing client need the new Polaris engine as yet.

Sage Intacct should have the feature to delete the entries if we have posted wrongly. Sage Intacct should able to work more smoothly at the time of generating reports. Should improve in customization of reports in an easy manner. Should able to sync with other software in less time so that it will save time.

Stop changing the workspace layout so often. The ability to organize your main page would be nice

I'm not involved but apparently the pricing model isn't great

I can’t use the app on my computer because it totally slows it down. Hard to find previously completed tasks sometimes. Easier feature needed to scroll to past dates more than a week ago. Very hard to find things a few months back.

Reporting capabilities. Project task and scheduling (Laying out the project plan with milestones and reporting on status reports). Resource Management stream- Making it easy for project assignment

I wish there was an option to add a-la-carte features to their plans, because the difference in cost between starter plans and the next step up is too much for us to afford. More features available to the starter packages would be nice.

out of the box office365 connectors with more options. user mapping from azure AD to groups and profiles should be easier to setup. hybrid view fully compatible with profile configurations on menu options visibility

Allow scheduled carousel posts on Instagram. More information on reporting. It can be glitchy at times

Lack of flexibility on candidate profiles for global companies

Website - too much information. Onb 2.0 candidate emails

Calculation function. Could add more most commonly used calculations. Add more layouts. Doesn't have to type a name for each item. Store previous versions. Like when you accidentally delete something, I found that I couldn't find it anymore.

As Avalara is connected to the invoicing system, it cannot be used for cash basis reporting. Would like to see it reference our system invoice names on the summary screens (currently have to click through to the transactional level to see it)

Would be nice to be able to block unwanted numbers.

performance on very large frames. more efficient fields to count hours and minutes. bug fix in file upload

You can create an album to share with those outside of your firm, but the only way to do this is to download files into a zip file. This is antiquated thinking. It would be much better if you could create an album that would generate a temporary web page that anyone outside of the organization could view by clicking on a link. There are a number of legacy items that are no longer functional. OpenAsset needs to either make these functional or remove the options.

Perhaps expanding for additional types of databases will be helpful for future growth - columnar, vector, etc.

In Jira cards we need to add some more custom fields details in it

Customer have complain regarding not knowing where to go to complete there work. Modernize the UI. Accessibility to customer data

the possibility of linking projects not only tasks. the capability of adding reminders to tasks or projects not necessarily by assingning. due dates only. the capability of adding predecessor or successor tasks or projects without having to add due dates

connection clarity could use improvement on voice calls. would love customization to toggle voicemail settings from mobile app

I would like to have a bit more insight into the things I don't know, I know what I use it for, but I am sure it can do so much more.

Customizable Slack alerts (not only every hour in the hour). Better payment plans for more users (considering users that only review information)

Algorithm doesn't make sense sometimes. Need to show more points in the front DB. Maintenance should be with prior notice to the users.

Some descriptions in the invoice Excel are confusing to customers who don't make payments in USA. If it would be more clear, it would save the time to seek help back and forth.

Exception details are difficult to understand the root cause. Sweep system could be improved, custom policies should be able to schedule independently instead of subscribing it to default policies. Background searches are not so easy to use. Bulk actions do not show progress

Loading times and refresh rates. (Especially when starting up). Overall interface flow could improve as its tricky to get to certain sub tasks. Date assignment is over complicated for what is needed, sometimes bugs out if your flow is wrong

Schedule recurring tasks. Profile section with assigned tasks. Calendar view for tasks. Notes for annotations

An integration with Lattice would be amazing, if not already available

Integrations. Observability. Service Tickets expertise

Sometimes the use is more for people with coding experience not everyday office personnel. Setting up automations need a bit more explanation at times, I often have to reach out to the help center. When labeling things, each column has it's own labels. It'd be nice to have the ones already created show up to be reused, not recreated.

Communication from support. Following through with system integrations. Ease in implementation

sub tasks

How timelines are showed. Folders are limited to two levels only, and could use more granularity so boards and docs could be further organized

More over in Ceipal ATS no queries in that.

More connections with major providers Ex. John Hancock retirement services. Faster UI - it has gotten better but is still slow at times

Support for creation of workflows for Box and Dropbox. Connectors like Power Automate

Creating address lists can be tricky at first but there are good trainings available.

UI/UX of its website. Identify unknown emails as clean or dirty. Also allow to upload excel file

User manuals. Provide and advertise training. More support to help our team learn

Create automations for guest users - i.e. notify a client when their ticket is ready. Create time based notifications - i.e. once a ticket has been delivered for over two weeks, send a chaser to client.

Sometimes the software is unresponsive. I also experiencing some bug occasionally. Comments are viewed and order historically, hence it's difficult to have context if commenting on older comments

Increases for data system can process when it comes to reporting. Allowing strategic structure capabilities to be similar to all others, currently limited in add/deletes from a structure standpoint and have to go the portfolio route.

More templates. Cheaper prices. Add on templates should be free

Integration to Azure DevOps wiki. Copy paste not always easy

Performance. Dynamic Cart Update. Merge multiple legal documents

Litmos could improve by allowing for managers to be able to see downline in their reporting heirarchy instead of just their direct reports. Litmos could improve with a better way to search their content library with key words

Integration with other platforms

The Slack integrations are a bit limited and needs improvement

Dashboards are not user-friendly like the boards, I think it can be better. Adding currencies rate could save a lot of time especially when we are tracking expenses in more than one currency. Items count to be added automatically

create Mogrts that don't break or have flicker when using in Premiere Pro. Be able to have 2 views of the full comp and the comp with a layer or effect turned off (instead of toggling on/off). When using linear wipe on text, have the transition percentage encompass only the text length (not the text in regards to where it is on the composition)

Make the Admin UI more user friendly. Reporting analytics should be included. Allow to have multiple pages open

User interface and experience. Documentation and training. Reporting capabilities. Mobile experience

At some point, I feel there is a performance degradation, so it may reduce the speed of the app. There is a lack of support when it comes to the advanced development features. There is no option to add CC or BCC people for the notification. This option should be provided.

can't figure out anything specific

I think it would be great to add an optional feature that sends you a ping when its a person's birthday.

Initial implementation help

Unfortunately, there is no provision of morethan one one network interface in each virtual server instance of z/OS systems. As a limitation at resource sharing, mainly Disks are not able to share between z/OS virtual server instances. Compression is one of the key feature should be included to support in the PCIe

The features are awesome. I have familiarized with al the set features. The overall performance is good.

Graph performance

A centralized dashboard should be there for analytics. Creating custom durations for sprints to accommodate for public holidays. Hovers for task descriptions for subtasks should also exist. The mobile app is not very easy to navigate when there are multiple boards. Template creation for sprint board structures would be great

RDS price may be complicated, with various aspects such as instance type, storage, I/O operations, and data transmission influencing costs. RDS may lag in supporting the most recent versions of database engines.

Being able to comment on a specific step on the card instead of only being able to comment on the cards entirety. Adding in more specific keyword features.

it can be jumpy. the redraw can take a while. difficult to use on a large scale / print projects

Better pricing options. Tailored UK portal. Better design features

Double usage of colors (i.e. if I want two of the same shade of red for two different groups or statuses, but different individual items). The color green not being restricted to the 'done' effects

slow backup times on O365. jobs fail easily if a large mailbox

More prominent transfer, hold, and leave icons.

Product deletions in mass require support ticket. Changing property names. Channel limitations - clearer limit sets

User Interface. Expensive. Documentation is up to date.

less complication. create more user-friendly approach. graphical user interface can be improved. storage can be improved.

implement an invoicing system

In our organization, we've done quite a bit of customization on certain components of the product. For example, it's a bit limited from a column control for content perspective. So we've had our developers come in and make changes to the components and deploy them so we can use them to deliver the business requirements.

Overall speed of development has led to regular minor bugs/issues

Maybe some kind of integration with MS Teams and breakout rooms. Adding sound experience - the facilitator (or anyboby) can play a sound from the library or any other source for the whole group - it would add a twist to our meetings. AI module for making notes out of selected content - texts on postits, schemas

Adding even more integrations. Adding some way to use values in items, for example, the total for one column, so you can estimate the % incidence of each item. Improving formulas and filters

Can be slow at times. Marking items complete sometimes do not move on to the completed list in a timely fashion

sometimes the backup that it says is there isnt. it is sometimes slow. searching is not everywhere accurate

Ease of use/tooltips for more technologically challenged users.

I find it doesn't always pick up every keystroke. I don't have the issue with any other program. I can't think of anything else!

Requiring a third party for configuration. Delay in NS2 features being released. Slow responses

OCR Technology. VAT Recognition. Faster Expense Report creation

eliminating the manual transfer process from ID to ID. reporting with time off accruals and linking with pay checks. I-9 process and being able to completed

analytics. load times. getting logged out. drag and drop upload

Support via Ariba connect - slow resolution, asking questions that were already mentioned in the ticket. PDF uploader with Cloud Trade

Extension on gmail could operate better. linkedin integration is not helpful. contact data would be great

Allowing the groups to have unique columns would be wonderful. There are times when a board has many groups, but the needs within the group are not the same. The change for all columns within a board to be the same is very limiting unless people move items from group to group. Not all users use the boards/groups this way. There is a column for links and a column for files. However, the File view does not show the files that are linked. This would be helpful. When the board is wide, it makes it a challenge to see what is needed easily. Less scrolling by using the file section in the update area would be wonderful.

Reporting. end user customization (Look and feel) example user themes

RCM is missing many features and have a lot of influence tickets opened. Managing RCM is not easy, as we need licensed consultant to support in many changes required (use of XML for configuration does not make sense to me). SuccessFactors whole platform version should be the same when migrating from an environment to the other. This was a problem for us when we had launched the system, in Preview it was perfect, and the same exact configuration was moved to Production, but we faced several issues with production that wasn't in preview

I don't have many improvements. Maybe to make the dashboard a little more customisable with the colours so you can add your own brand palette?. I actually loved the previous side bar before the new update was released. Still getting used to the new layout!

Can make it a bit easier for a team to use an account

Compensation data. Nicer employee profiles where you can upload documents, enter variable compensation and annual bonus. More customizable performance reviews, it is not easy to use

Over time, pricing is increasing as Zendesk breaks apart prior bundled features by license, and we would like to see better discounts for long-term customers. Chat Support is mixed- some agents supporting us as a Client don't fully review everything needed to resolve at 1st point of contact, while others do take that step. Offer more training (free) for reporting and multi-brand set up.

When you export to spreadsheet would be great if you can transcribe the formats, color and shapes.

The performance has been the best. Carrying out test cases has been running effectively.

Customization - You can't have a single instance, it will automatically comes with multiple AZ. Better Integration with other AWS services

Image masking is the major feature I would love to see in miro. Need more defined frame sizes. Need more AI design elements. Need more visual design elements support

I would say making sure that it has full integration across all the hyperscalers such as AWS, Microsoft, and Google. That would be a key area for me.

Hanging more tabs options. Need more options of communication with each employee. Different colors for coloring coding

Email notifications for administrators. Standalone feature for backing up SharePoint repositories

The UI isn't terrible, but it could definitely be better. The initial opening of the software takes several minutes, and could potentially be optimized for faster loading. In-program tutorials to help walk new people through processes that can get complicated.

Poor reporting functionality, they want you to purchase an additional budgeting & reporting module. Due to the level of customization, there were some complexities during go-live that created additional errors. Expensive compared to other ERP systems

Me and my fellow trainers (from different organization) have hard time copying boards from my each others' Miros. sometimes participants cannot enter a board as guests, without sharing their emails (which they not always want to do). sometimes uploading pictures takes looong time

Would love to see a function that allows companies to create chatbots pulling from their data stored in Guru. Ability to gamify progress through a series of Guru cards

A little bit costly, they should make prices more competitive. Webex Meetings should allow more information to be seen by participants because currently that's not provided. The scheduling feature sometimes is not automatic making you have to enter an ID manually.

Accessibility (after hours). Occasional one-size-fits-all approach. Occasional terminology differences

Documentation is oftentimes missing key information for proper implementation. This is circumvented by reading third-party guides or contacting support for additional details. They do not push Fail-Closed as much as I think they should. Fail-Open is fairly trivial to bypass and it should be made known to the customer during setup how much this will affect overall security. More vendor integration is something that is always craved by administrators. There are so many third-parties to integrate with.

Integration with other tools like PageProof could be better

An App pretty please. Mobile Responsive design - its very hard to use on my phone

ability to backup Azure resources (it does some but needs a wider spectrum). flexibility in cloud storage sources like setting up DR in an azure instance instead of only AWS. ability to delete data from their google workspace we have 97TB stuck and can't be deleted

Version management can be improved. It gets irritating at times. Limited query language as compared to some other industry rivals. Pricing is a little high

Timeline logic to set and update timeline dates when milestones change. Scope - there's not really a good place to put this. we use the info boxes section which is apparently a legacy feature but IDK where also we would store this without having to create a linked document each time. Project Plan collaboration - it's hard to share with clients just their project plan so they can view real-time updates

Takes a little time to get the hang of every feature. Onboarding new users takes some time

API. Integrations. Electronic fax

No ability to easily duplicate tickets. HubSpot CRM just deleted one of our deals pipelines for no reason and dumped everything from that pipeline into a 'e-commerce pipeline' and cannot find an explanation as to why and how to resolve the issue. We are stuck with many customer deals that were along our sales journey in various stages that are now just dumped in buckets that mean nothing. Once a property on a ticket or deal is made as a single select, there is no option to change it to multi select - you need to re-create a whole new property which doesn't work if you have many tickets or deals that already utilise the existing single select.

Customization is limited. Definitely more expensive. Not easy to navigate

On the fly DB Vertical Scaling could be useful. Connection Display & stats can be present to see and improve app design

Functionality in journal entries. ability to easily make some cells the same while entering journal entries

Sometimes processes are not automated in the best way, that is, the person responsible for using the tool must contribute and carry out this analysis to avoid problems. Initial implementation and configuration can require an investment of considerable time and resources. It is also important to have qualified people to make the most of the data collected by the tool. Another point to keep in mind is data privacy, since the tool can manipulate sensitive data in the process mining process. It's a complex system to understand and truly master

Setting up initial settings can be daunting without their support. The Search query can be difficult to learn until you gain the experience. Determining how to setup automatic messages back to employees initially

Ease of use. Setting up templates

CRM Integration for contacts could be improved, every day I have my lists to exclude my HubSpot contacts, but there are still a noticeable amount that show up on my list. The same goes for contacts that I have already exported and have opted to leave them out of my search.

Providing constant communication for in-office work, while working remote. tracking progress of each job. daily update to the team for each individual project

Automation are missing. Connection to outer platforms. Mobile support

Onboarding (as whole). Reporting. mass changes. search engine. Knowledge Base Articles or Community. Concentrate all the settings in one one hub

It's still, at the end of the day, a very traditional platform in by that we mean it's a bulk air platform. There are too many components, which means a lot more operating costs in terms of manageability and things like that. We have tried to streamline that as much as we can, but the multiple components still exist. If anything, Adobe could kind of think about that a little bit to maybe decouple some of those and make them a more slimmer platform. I think that would help. I think that a lot of customers are still in the traditional environment and as we ourselves are looking to move to the cloud, I think some of that will get taken care of, but I think that's one area where it would help if Adobe can put some thoughts into that.

I think the calendar should be easier to use. I think Search can be improved

Scalability concerns. This is a great platform for SMBs, but may not work particularly well in large organizations. Difficult for the non tech savvy user. Longer ramp time for them. Some automations are limited, but they are improving each month.

monday.com is a well-rounded tool that fits the needs of our team.

Email comms functionality and plugins. Measuring email comms interactions. Still required to run email support alongside cannot totally replace support@inbox just yet. Easier data imports and exports.

To be honest I really don't have any complaints at this time.

Uptime checks only seam to be possible with synthetic monitoring. Events for logs not grouped. Logging of confluent kafka

so far, i don't see any room for improvement

Show more example templates. Making the mobile phone interface clearer. Making the application faster.

No complaints pretty efficient

Learning the platform can be complicated. Posting shorter videos to help troubleshoot and problem-solved

Make the calendar a little smaller so you can see more on the screen

Editing current transactions via upload option. Directly receiving payments from customers without third party applications. Making payments directly to Vendors from Sage Intacct

Setting up manager access is a clumsy and burdensome process. I would like to see Paycom revise this process so that system administrators do not have to set employees up with separate manager login credentials for client side access. It would be great if employees could toggle between their ESS and manager profiles without having to first set up their client side access with a separate set of login credentials.

I would love for formula columns to be more usable in automations and other calculations. I would love to be able to be able to forecast resource for a quarter without the need of formulas. I would like 1 way integration from GitHub to monday.com so that I don't need to grant monday.com access to code repos.

Support could be stronger on first touch. The need to escalate and wait has been experienced through the years. Reluctance to come “take a look” and the time it takes to gather logs is extensive.

Ordering capability. Expense tracking and submission

Keep tabs of more dates than just the initial dates. For ex. keep tabs for first look dates, final creative dates, and delivery dates. send notifications for upcoming due dates

Customer Reps do push to be reviewed

easier to reupload. auto de-duping based on email addresses. recommended Salesforce format

Employee referrals. In my experience, there is lack of innovation in Recruiting space. In my opinion, Inability to search job profiles by job code. Requirement to have a Provisioning partner to complete certain tasks

Providing more differentiation between user roles. Ease of time tracking. Embedded reimbursements or ability to sync with a platform like Divvy

To enhance user experience it would be beneficial to make the interface more user friendly and easier to navigate. This can be achieved by simplifying the layout offering help when needed and utilizing terminology that's easily understandable. Additionally incorporating reporting features that are customizable will empower users to generate reports tailored to their individual requirements. In order to enhance the solutions efficiency optimizing the code and implementing data structures would prove valuable.

better reporting options for more complex data analysis. would be helpful to incorporate more business processess like employee timesheets. would like to see client invoicing features to generate quotes and invoices and collect payments right from monday.com as a native feature, not a third party add-on

I don't fully understand all of the tools they have to offer. Some of the reporting can be complex. Changing the user setting for one individual was challenging

Batch optimisation. Cost to company is high for IBM Z. Less resources available as per market demand.

Organization or the Interface (GUI) is not funny, and it could be much more appreciated. Personal libraries should include search element. Timeout to log out is very short, and sometimes you are discounted without an announcement.

Configuration backup and restore

DUO Integration

Parameter groups are sometimes confusing at the moment of editing. Just supports certain amount of databases.

Improve dependency functionality, making it easier and automatic to populate. Provide more monday.com docs templates

Could be more streamlined. Could have a more basic version (it is a step up in complexity from quickbooks). When trying to go back to a previous page/task (the 'done' or 'back' buttons) sometimes do go back too far, but sometimes they do. More consistency of how those buttons work would help.

Honestly, I'd probably have to think about that one. I mean, it's not that they're not there, just that's not on the top of my head.

Faster screen loading times. Ability to add multiple new COs to an invoice when billing. This was previously an option, but it changed with an update about a year ago, and you now have to add the COs one at a time, which is time-consuming. A dedicated sales rep who knows your account and makes suggestions based on your particular usage and needs.

There is no way to create an auto-incrementing numeric field. This is a common need for things like request numbers that need to be a human readable number that can be linked to other applications or the physical world. There are reporting and analysis features, but they are difficult to learn, not intuitive and cumbersome. Managing custom fields can be difficult. Maybe this is more of a user issue, but we have duplicate or similar custom fields and some fields are inherited that we do not want in sub-projects.

More Intuitive Interface. Less Complexity For File Level Restores. More Training Options

User Interface. Integration with non popular ERPs. Less window jumping within the application

Uploading docs sometimes is difficult. Duplicates certain projects with similar other projects. Notification of comments can be reduced

The customer service response needs to be better. All representatives are friendly to work with but from time of submission of the issue to resolution averages about a week, perhaps more. With new launches, the "bugs" in the system always require troubleshooting. This is fine but this leads to longer response times as the CSR team hasn't been trained on how to fix them. We have had lots of issues of who to go to for what issues, which also leads to the lag time in responses. We follow the protocol, only to find out our contact is no longer with the company or was on vacation. Again, this is what causes a lot of our delays in having any issues addressed and resolved.

I've given this feedback to them already, but I'm getting tasked with setting up executive dashboards and have become the go-to person to set up scheduled reports for our CIO, our CEO, and all the vice presidents. So one of our senior vice presidents challenged me to get them all in one email because they're getting probably 10 emails (or however many reports I have out there depending on the person). I was trying to set up some automation, and I ended up having to use a different tool, Microsoft Power Automate, to combine those links for those reports to click in there. There's no way in the tool that you can do those things. Sharing is not great in my opinion, and I've spoken to them about that and it sounds like they're coming out with some better sharing capabilities. So that would be my biggest thing is like AI automation and then how do I share this in a really efficient manner to executives that don't necessarily want to get 10 emails just from this in the morning when they already get a ton of other emails.

More pre-defined functions for ETL SCD option. More datatype support. configuration and setup can be made simple

Maybe allow us to dynamically move div around like scratch Sometime get emails, sometime doesn't get emails would be nice to create sub-branch of email based on changes made in Litmus rather than SFMC

Difficult to setup. Not the best at Event correlation. Recurring cost very high

SAAS, across the board

Litmus could offer cheaper plans for folks who just want to render test. 2. Litmus could offer more hands-on practical coding advice with Litmus Live 3. Litmus template are is a little clunky in how it saves.

presentation skills

all employees trained the same. friendliness. phone edicate

Some of the canned reports can't be modified. We work with a reseller for some basic reporting that should have been included.

links between boards on different pages. automatic emails to remind about open inquiries. simpler/ easier to customise automations

Pricing

Multifactor Authentication. Integration with other applications. Alludo's acquisition of Awingu will enable a lot more features and fucntionality that has been missing

Customization options for the customer. Fix how often linkedin gets disconnected from the platform

syncing information from one program to another. (ie, Salesforce and Monday)

Most of the things I can think of have now been addressed in this new release. Documentation could be less ambiguous sometimes. More active to detecting system alerts and having them sorted before we have need to inform them SAAS

better notifications when something is an issue. IE: tax set up or payments. Audits of payroll deductions vs. benefit enrollment. the ability to print a live check by employee would be nice.

Sometimes there are so many layers that it is difficult for me to find an attachment or what board something was posted on.

I wish the videos were not that easy to be downloaded by the learners. Litmos can work on the dashboard for showing all the courses. Sometimes we get the complain that people do not see all their courses and they should switch between tabs. Litmos can improve the peoples management features with more freedom to the account admins to manage accounts.

No auto-save - always forget to press save after every edit bugs if open in more than one tab - shows an old version (very confusing) subject line and pre-header aren't correct in proof mode

Better integration with Google Workspace - it is choppy and is limited in funcionality

The feature I'd love is to be able to tab between the boxes/columnswhen you are in the item card view. Also in item card view, being able to print those. Showing the overall total on a graph would be helpful. Right now you have to use one widget for the bar graph and another for the grand total

Provide for the direct submission of Payroll Based Journaling to CMS.

In my opinion, customer service. In my opinion, transactional relationship. In my opinion, communication with their customers

Since the verification came back as verified, we did not know what would happen if it failed, some examples or use cases published on their site would be helpful in this case. A white paper explaining how this could satisfy I-9 requirements. It would be nice if we could customize the verification report generated.

The phone app could be a little more useful. The "to do" feature could be better

Liquid cooling of the servers can reduce heat generation. From NBD warranty, they can move to a same-day warranty. Preventive maintenance during the warranty period.

It is sometimes difficult to find the appropriate report I'd like to run in Workforce Analytics. Afterhours support on chat would be very beneficial

I am not sure

Advanced Document Editing. Desktop Functionality. User Interface Customization

Hierarchy output without BI. More Flexibility in Onboarding

Slow rollout times need improvement. Ability to hyperlink would be nice. Credits get expensive with large messages

Sometimes I find the navigations is a little quirky. May just be me, however I sometimes get lost in how to navigate from one accountability to the next. This could be made easier with a quick search function.

I cannot think of anything that I would change at this time

Users aren't super familiar with the platform. When working with a remote team it is tricky to walk users through it

AI-based controls. Better controls on mass processing. Should be easy to implement custom business rules

There are a few complex use cases where we've had to reach out to Groove support / solution architects to come up with a proper solution. It would be great to see something like a "How We Solved That Using Groove" knowledge base created to help get the creative solution innovation flowing more for us before we have to formally reach out for support. It would also be nice if the Groove dialer had a way to better interact with inbound phone trees and/or more tutorials provided on how to set up Groove according to best practices with the top phone solutions like Zoom Phone. Groove Conversations is good, but it still has a ways to go to be an equivalent of other top tools in this space like Gong and Chorus. Our reps would like the ability to initiate an outbound phone call from their cell phone and have it be auto-logged without any involvement of their desktop Groove dialer app.

Notifications of failed service. Map of regions without service

The GUI. The Documentation. The Support is slow.

Summary reports. Total taxes paid reports. Total IRA contributions report.

Could be easier to add features from mouse right button. Could have themes. Links between different points on more scenarios

Notifications can be a bit overwhelming, but are customizable. Visual interface is a bit dated

Replies to updates do not have a WYSIWYG editor. Board search doesn't seem to search content in updates / replies. The interface has improved a lot and I've grown used to it by now, but it was a little daunting and overwhelming when I first started using it.

Product documentation is at times poorly written and hard to understand, in particular KBAs. Even with enhancements like CPQ Admin, our CPQ administrators find the solution highly complex and difficult to maintain and configure. Even with small carts, system performance is not adequate.

More freedom to create custom dashboards as on the previous versions we could do much more. The Performance TAB windows is too small and cannot be resized or maximized when looking at reports for "Overview", "File System" and any of those items. There are not enough widgets o create stunning dashboard in AP2

Alert rules are not working properly. Anomaly detection. Finding dropped flows

Flexibility. Alignment with Account Service and Partners

I wish there was a resizing option for files that are too large. I wish there was an option to view the posts set up like Instagram in the 12 view. I wish there was a "memory" template for hashtags or other content that is used on a regular basis.

Updated UI. Better intergrations with Marketo, Wordpress, and Drift. Better documentation. Improved speaker camera options (filtering/mirroring)

Web editor. Metrics

Would like better mass change tools. For a novice user, having "everything" available can be overwhelming vs. giving the user a "recommended" set of things to manage and then opting in and enhancing as they learn and can do more.

Additional manager access. Compensation module.

It works very well for my purposes

Easier ways to silence on weekends when not in office

Notifications

Large Error Messages. Error Message consisting of code instead of words. Load Times

I'd like to see even more widgets and plug ins

If you look at AEM, I think it's a very mature product. I mean, every product can be improved on a normal basis. New technology will come, you will add new technology, for example, you add all the AI and all this kind of stuff. That's all. But otherwise, if any particular thing which I say, oh, if that is, that it would have been best, I don't think so. AEM is pretty much a very comprehensive product. I would say that.

I'm going to be a little blunt here. So the way how MPP and bombs are getting separated out, that is creating some issues when we want to implement end-to-end processes. The bomb team, the manufacturing or the sector manager kind of team, tries to give various features for the materials and bombs related to them, but all of those features are not available for BOP. For example, solution variant creation. When we have a variant based structure, I can create a solution variant for bombs, but I cannot create a solution variant for BOPs and this is, I would say something of a gap that Siemens should address and get it fixed. We have to do customization, but if the product is itself giving us then this is an elegant way to push it further. This is what I would say is the issue.

Convert maps into 3D trees. Maps should move, interact, and show the branches alternatively.. Play mode. The software should be more proactive. Ask (prompt) the ideas automatically. Once the idea is written, it should automatically open to write the children concepts. Ask the user if the map should start presenting itself in 3D mode or 2D mode showing all the concepts interactively. USE AI to create an interactive map.

Not really anything to be honest

Having multiple teams linked to the same account. Inviting collaborators without needing to be on a team. User leaving company loses their boards.

Get more customizations and features to make the player even stronger.

Time tracking could be better, we currently use the numbers column instead of time. There are some automations that we weren't able to locate, though I can't remember the exact examples right now.

Access to more custom reports in normal package. Setting up admin rights/access slightly easier. Faster custom report creation

Adding subitems to subitems. Viewing full text within the column box instead of a pop out bubble for temporary viewing

Reporting & Analytics

Software Cost of the Platform

pricing. sometimes very slow. not cordless, which makes desk look sloppier

Expensive tool if you are on a budget. Custom configuration can be difficult and complex to implement for the first time. Learning Curve: Implementing and customizing qTest to suit your organization's specific needs may have a learning curve, and it could take time for team members to become proficient with the tool.

allocating to grants on timesheets. organization of reports

We need to be able to add road side service repairs not just scheduled maintenance. I would like to be able to pull more functional reports. There is a button when doing query of logs for a period of time that says to export, AND IT SENDS TO THE DOT BUT DOES NOT SAY THAT IS WHAT IT WILL DO!!!!!!!!!!!!

I always seem to struggle with finding a simple search button on the home screen to search for a contact - total user blindness. It tells us that your subject line could use improvement, but doesn't really give you good examples of what I should do to improve it. I wish it would use AI technology and just rewrite the subject line. I wish I could find a tutorial on best practices for journeys and how to use EVERY thing it has to offer. Maybe offer a Mailchimp 101 class with Q&A monthly/quarterly.

Missing of Integration with Emerging Technologies like Containerization and Orchestration. Cost Management and Pricing Transparency. Complexity of Configuration and Documentation.

Too many kinks still in solutions that are generally available. Have to use provisioning partners to do many things. Not super user friendly or intuitive, still need IT for too much configuration.

An issues reporting forum to see issues other companies may experience, troubleshooting and resolution steps taken to resolve

More webinars on using NFG effectively

Report to have the date feature back; when you run a report, you can see the date it is picking up. Enhance mobile access to have more features. LMS, add more features to get good reporting results, notification that new hires are missing mandatory training.

We have not runinto any issues other then trying to get lower pricing but we do that with all vendors

maybe a feature to alert the system admin when your having a problem with your token. some how make it easier for end users to move mobile phones

X-author for migration of products

Deploying. Tinymce config

Azure rightsizing and RI recommendations. Utilization reporting. Anomaly detection

There is no ability to show Gantt for one specific task and subtask from the task box. It would be nice if there was an option to quickly be able to do this to highlight one particular task/project timeline. Toggle in settings to show the location field at the top of a task like it used to. Can edit the date when looking at all the subtasks in a task, but not the status. This would save so many clicks for me.

The algorithms used by the Process Mining could use custom fine-tuning. larger pool of undocumented processes. deeper report for root cause analysis

Report creation for expenses could be faster. The mobile version is not as streamlined as the desktop version.

Building dashboards can be a little tricky, but Wrike's customer service is quick to respond and quite helpful. The onboarding videos have been so helpful to our team—I would like a deeper dive into using Dashboards and Reports added to these resources for our team to reference. Teams must come to a consensus about which notification settings are a must for ease of communication. We found that if someone only has daily reports turned on and at-mentions silenced, notifications are not as effective. There is not currently a way to add images or embedded links in forms. This would be helpful for us as we develop forms for design requests so that recipients can select from different options with a visual. When developing forms, there is only an option to include one tag with the ticket/task/project that results. We use multiple tags to keep projects visible in different team folders, so having that option would be quite helpful in saving us the time of tagging requests manually.

Pipelines - being able to share them or have permissions based viewing capabilities. Table size limits are small for really large apps. While I agree that there needs to be a cap on the size, it would be nice to adjust it up when needed.

Options of Different types of automatic voicemails. Options for a different voice of the default greeting for the voicemail.

The site has become 'glitchy' lately; cannot properly edit or add email addresses easily

Lag time when loading pages needs significant improvement. The information that can be filtered into widgets can be limiting. It would be so helpful to have formula choices in a dropdown with a cheat sheet of what they can do. Allowing weekends to be enabled or disabled per individual

More examples of use cases and templates. More options for automatic adjustments to allow timelines to be built based on when something should be finishing. Easier search functionality to find content and analyse

Click-throughs could be more seamless

Accuracy. User Interface

Getting started is a bit challenging. It would be nice to be able to save dashboard templates and have filters carry over

Linking to slides. Linking to excels and works on it online

A few tweaks and additions to the way certain metrics can be tracked on the monday.com boards

Program and Portfolio management - cumbersome to get program or portfolio roadmaps. High-level capacity management when project timelines change

Payroll Specialist constantly turnover. Apple Notifications for App are not consistent

When uploading multiple files, Monday.com will scramble the files, and they upload in different orders. As a content manager, a lot of things in my posts need to be in chronological order, and I spend a lot of time uploading to Monday.com one post at a time to keep the files in order. I would love to be able to drag and drop content into Monday.com and it is in the order I intended. Formatting of Monday.com on iOS can be cumbersome to navigate. Certain views and functions are inaccessible on mobile. The minor thing here- when moving things from group to group, I would love to not have my saved sort be adjusted. Oftentimes, we're making quick adjustments but still want to keep my sort view intact.

No ability to integrate with Google Workspace workloads

Our instance of Epi does not allow content authors to see thumbnails of graphics when building content blocks and pages. Our instance of Epi is fairly inflexible in the way the content blocks and pages were developed - if a business need has changed since the original scope of the page or block, we can't easily make adjustments.

Adding more training on Report building beyond the basics. Add more flexibility to enhance the report look/format, set up as we have with Micosoft Excel. Support to Clients is varied- some Zendesk staff are thorough and helpful while others just offer basic responses without resolving the actual issue

App for desktop management. GIS usage. Videos. text to speech

Certain automation is lacking. For example, I would like the ability to add a date and then it’ll automatically calculate the due date for me certain calculations like this I feel are lacking or are not user-friendly. I really wish there was a customer service number with life customer and support or Live chat. I would like it to be a little more user-friendly

it's a little costy. it can be complex to implement. it's third party so you have less controll

It could be easier to have the availability of joining a meeting of a different platform. USB Passthrough should be a default standard for any Room device. UX is the greatest, but devices could be cheaper

Options to show where to make a change such as 'report to'. Suggests to show what is needed to make changes such as name change, etc

Board Relationships

Shipping is a disaster. Inflated shipping rates sometimes equal to the actual product cost. Delay in getting items. It can take 4-5 weeks in some cases for items to be ready to ship. Store credit setup is confusing.

Design wise it needs an upgrade on the looks. Some options bug constantly. Direct support should improve.

I have noticed some bugs in the Nintex Workflow Designer with the State Machine action. For example, in the State Machine action, when you delete a state, the branch still shows and take many refresh to actually not show anymore. In the Workflow Designer, when we use a Flexi Task action: in the text for Task Notifications field there is no "word wrap" unless we skip a line the text we write just continues and gets of the visible part of the field. This is not at all a major issue but if it could be improved it would be great. It usually take at least 4 minutes to run a "Change State" it would be great if this time could be reduced. If Nintex support forum could be more reliable with the questions and responses that would be great. There is a lot of products in the Nintex Process Platform that we have no training on. I would not be surprised if the decision makers within our companies are even aware that those products exit.

Keywords can sometimes be conveluded. Multiple cards get pulled that don't make sense

More flexible licensing models. Reporting capabilities aren't as deep or as rich as other platforms. Outages while seldom do happen on occasion.

Stability of the app when bulk operations. such as heading being moved doesn't sync immediately. Also, the notification does't really work. Not really interested in the contents

UI can feel a little cluttered. It could save even more time with more advancements in AI.

Requires constant updates. Occasional bugs. Occasional Faulty info

Navigation could be more user friendly. Improve search results. Reorganize the Home page

report are very slow if data is high. workflow not trigger as per expected scheduled time

Maintainability would be probably the best improvements I can do. We had a lot of upgrading issues in the past. For us, it's still Noma Sure. Products that are still, Cisco is still developing and it become better. But in terms of upgrade, it's what we had the most issue.

Formulas within the boards. Integrations between boards. Pricing.

Localize payroll. Support in Spanish from SAP for me

It would be great if the previous routing page can be viewed through the current page I'm looking at. It would be great if the source of the image where derived from can be found in the page I am at.

Technical service can be challenging there usually is a communication issue. Tech support is always very pleasant but sometimes just don't get what the issue is. That has been the only downfall with 8x8

The Jira integration could use a little tweaking.

Portal / Dashboard. Integration across tools. System resources efficiency

The developed data orchestration models performs perfectly. This is great product with effective revenue generation models. I am impressed by the operation of the features.

I am 100% satisfied

Have received differing answers. Alignment would be good. Could have used higher leadership for better implementation guidance. Didn’t like that a date was not given for ONB 1.0 deplatform earlier on. Could have taken actions sooner to mitigate being without ONB module.

Better customer support. Complex steps and menu ambiguity. Missing configuration options for Windows. Missing MacOS configuration features vs Windows

Dashboards could do with being more "out of the box" friendly. I constantly switch bewteen the new AP2 and classic view for different functions. different user privileges could do with being more generic or simpler

The automated A/B testing winner selection and application should be added. The flexibility of message shape, specifically incorporating transparency so messages do not need to be a rectangular shape. Faster and more reliable servers around the globe. Making more detailed use cases and tutorials to be followed can simplify things for users

Education material and videos for beginners. More templates. More languages

Onboarding ease for applicant. Include support person throughout implementation. Maybe let implementation last a little longer

Mostly just little things I'd like to see. I know that, obviously, moving from one platform to another one, there's going to be bumps where we're used to doing something one way we have to learn the new way. So that hasn't been too much of a problem, but there are little quirks I think could be better. I think searching through the menus could be a little easier instead of always having to go back to the main menu so then go to the next menu. That could be a little easier. And mostly just other little tweaks like with gamification on some of the scorekeeping would be a good thing.

Automations can be complex to setup - even getting a notification to slack isn't straightforward

has not kept up with other platforms on automation of segmenting. not intuitive. older design - requires more steps to accomplish the same thing

Reminders on due deadlines. More of new feature awareness. better sorting

Health care management and follow-up with heath care providers. Payroll deduction accuracy and monitoring.

Performance module - the request for additional feedback from colleagues is fragmented; allowing the form to only be sent to one commentator at a time results in delays in obtaining feedback from multiple individuals

Finding answers to questions can sometimes be difficult but I haven't found it impossible - yet. The colour palette for charts and graphs in Dashboards could be bigger - allowing us to choose colours that match our company colours.

If there could be a tab or a search bar on each page which can make it easier to search for any exact word or query

Employee Central - in my opinion, it looks like an old school database. UI - it got upgraded, but in my experience it's still behind workday. EC Service Center

In my opinion, Paychex Flex does not have good org chart software. In my opinion, The Benefits Platform is underwhelming and needs work. In my opinion, The support teams are hit or miss, we went through 7 different support users to find one that we linked. In my opinion, Communication from Paychex Flex lacks on major issues, which involved us getting fines for not submitting taxes on time. In my opinion, the hiring platform is also underwhelming and needs work.

I'd like to be able to have more than one Guru card open at once.

the structure of the surveys. the layout of the lists after their status. better demo at the beginning of usage

Ability to customize from the home exercise program. Easier searching for exercises. Maybe adding an email customer service option for non urgent questions.

User-facing dashboard. Policy management for devices

The initial setup was easy, but the AWS S3 immutable was not documented well

The item size limit of 400KB is something which we faced issue with once since we had a file of around 1-2MB that wasn't getting uploaded to the DB due to this issue

When zooming in it can sometimes be glitchy. An easier way to group items - see Adobe as a good example

integration with Salesforce sometimes confusing to set up. bi-directional functionality between Monday and Salesforce. more intuitive way to set up permissions and access levels

The file storage sometimes includes email logos and the likes. These can sometimes clog things up and make finding the actual files you need difficult. The sort order of the Gantt charts is too inflexible. Automations that change fields based on the value of other fields can be a bit slow. It would be good to have more specific examples of how others have set up monday.com. I couldn't really find anything specific to my needs, and spent quite some time before arriving at a workable solution.

Ability to access application files within UI

Range of colors. Emoji availability. Knowledge library that easily syncs with Google, MS, etc.

One issue is when an email has large attachments, PhishER does not work correctly.

8x8 contact center and work needs to be integrated

I think the policy builder can be a little bit difficult to understand at first. I'm not really sure how you make it easier. Because I know it's a difficult difficult area of configuration to approach as is, but you know, once you figure it out, you get it. But to get there, it takes quite a while. I had to read the books, watch the videos, talk to the experts, and then finally I got it and then it all makes sense.

It can add more advanced security auditing. Transfer from RDS to another database is complex, it can be improves. Frequent UI changes make daily work a little more challenging until we become accustomed to the New UI. However, there is always a choice to return to the previous user interface. Must support all types of famous databases.

More specific notifications. Template Library Customisation - this way we don't have to recreate a new template every time. Offline access - it would be great to have access to this offline when for example en route. More specific notifications that go to individual's email and modification of email text. App functionality enhancements

Copy-pasting behavior from windows program is poor (formatting never comes over right). Some tasks in rare instances randomly disappear. They decided to limit which colors you can choose as a user for your theme

I find it hard to navigate. The automation is fiddly. The mailing list is difficult to navigate. They used to be good then they changed to being really expensive

Improved data around audience behavior. Creating events and tracking can be tedious. Some campaigns can slow down site speed. Some of the out of the box templates are cool but not complete

Reporting module needs to be more flexible as it is not easy to switch between data representations easily.

Billing process for Germany. App-speed on windows devices

Performance module needs more options for customization

Integration with third-party tools. I cannot stream NL test data to a third-party DB and then plot graphs out of it. Keyboard shortcuts. It is tedious to use the mouse to click everywhere. I'd love to have some keyboard shortcuts. Reports and Analytics. Lacks intelligence in identifying patterns of problems

Maybe the automation can be fix by us meaning the user and not from Birdeye support. So whenever I add new Survey I can just edit the VA automation myself. Currently, i need to ask them for help with this. But they respond quickly. making the google monitoring refresh to automate force refresh at least twice a day?. making the requirements on sending thru SFTP be more easier so I won't get too much failed send.

More flexibility and access to create dashboards without needing so many external tools. ability to create reference docs inside of a board, or a notes/cheat sheet section at the top of a board that doesn't have to fit the same structure as the rest of the working board

Sometimes the error messages are a bit ambiguous requiring tech support to clarify. Not every scheduled backup works 100%. That said, I let it roll as the following one typically will.

Gantt Chart. Widgets. Third Party App Integration

Integration. Complex Advanced features. Limited customization

Reporting. Screen simplicity. Data modeling

Keyword search are not 100% accurate, Need improvement on that. Simplifying Dashboard. Internal DB is not accurate enough

Cost Tracking. Printable Asset Sheets

Better crossover between users internally. This has improved over the years, but there still can be some duplication of work. WebSights - great tool, but far too often am I unable to nail down the exact location the browsing came from. Advanced support for niche industries - ZoomInfo does not always recognize the industries or technologies that many industrial, manufacturing, and construction companies use.

Not intuitive to set up. Not for novice users. Not enough of visual choices. Data not always verified properly

Webex Meetings desktop app does not show meeting information shared from the Hybrid Calendar Service. Noise cancellation sometimes doesn't work. logging

It took me while to grasp the analytics set-up. While targeting is great, there are limitations on the things you can target in the email flow

while the learning curve is good, onboarding could be better. more help tracing warnings

Fixing issues promptly. Fixing issues the first time.

Forms - being able to customize them even more, with pictures etc.

In my opinion, APIs / integrations are sometimes coming to their limit. In my experience, no general archive available - therefore data sets cannot be frozen. Data roll-up for different hierarchy levels (program / project / sub-project) is very limited, in my opinion. In my opinion, when having showing a large number projects navigation on project tab is not very handy

Pricing rules. Quote cart page

Managing each service is a bit challenging, especially SAP DI.

Better baseline layout of tool- can overwhelm at 1st with all the tools it has. Organized training modules by topic. User forums

Accessability. user friendliness

Some cards require access and initially, access is denied. If a card is outdated, there is no way of knowing up front. If there is no card associated with the search, suggested cards are sometimes not related to the search

Overall Cost - Mainframes are expensive but you get what you pay for. Software & Hardware Maintenance are pricey. Learning curve for employees. Many MF folks have retired or are looking to retire

As a big company I would love to see more of what my peers are doing, which flows are working and get more visibility on actions around the world, so it would be great to see top flows in my organization and any other staticts and examples that could be seen on the tool itself

Most of the problems that Adobe Analytics as of now is having, it is getting addressed in a newer tool called Web Desk DK from implementation. They are already addressing that issue with the new tool and also the time data with the customer general analytics. So there is something not in workspace analysis and this is what they're addressing in customer general analytics. Which is good.

Marketing automation feature is not there yet. However, they say that they will launch it in a product update soon, we are looking forward to it. Limited number of themes and pre-build components available.

Did not seem to allow for segmented RDS backup instances, you had to backup the full instance. Console commands and controls could be improved

I wish Adobe could have some documentation or maybe training sessions, webinars, and maybe more people, to talk about how to improve the platform. So for example, we're building the new templates for web pages. And sometimes when we work with our in-house IT team, and then we have to do a very good segregation between content and code. And for one instance we deploy the code, we accidentally override the templates that we authored before. So there's not much documentation that can be found on the Adobe Experience League.

Regular search. AI answers to questions. Nothing else comes to mind

Easier reporting engine. Better ADP API/Integrations - we have had a problem with ours since day 1. The onboarding process for new admins to be more streamlined with mentors, agendas created and following a certain plan. We do not feel like we were set up for success and only had major issues when setting up our current LMS (Dec 2022-Apr 2023)

User Interface Complexity. Integration Challenges. Customization. Scalability
