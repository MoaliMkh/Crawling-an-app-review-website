Understanding the age, gender, and interests of website visitors with greater accuracy would assist marketers in crafting more targeted campaigns.\\nReal-Time Data: Similarweb provides historical data and trends, but real-time data is limited. In today's fast-paced digital landscape, having access to up-to-the-minute information is critical for making quick decisions and responding to changes in the market.
